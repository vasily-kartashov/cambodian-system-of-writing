# Subscript Consonant Symbols

## A. Subscript Forms

When two consonant symbols are pronounced consecutively (without an intervening vowel) within a word, the second (and sometimes, in medial position, a third) consonant symbol is written in a special subscript form below the first symbol. The form of the subscript is in most cases a smaller version of its superscript counterpart, but without the ... /saq/ ‘hair’ (not to be confused with the /treysap/(...); see Chap. II, A 2) which adorns the top of seven consonant symbols. Some subscripts, on the other hand, bear no discernible relationship to their counterparts, and must be learned in addition to the basic superscript forms. These subscripts are called ... /.../ ‘consonant feet’ in Cambodian, and the resulting consonantal groups are referred to as ... /.../ ‘combined consonants’

### 3. Special Combinations

Certain special combinations of superscript plus subscript represent a single
phonological consonant rather than a sequence of consonants. They are:

a) ... /.../ as in ... /laan/ car
b) ... /.../ ~ /.../ as in ... /.../ to pactice, ... /.../ crowd
c) ... /.../ as in ... /.../ there, that's it
d) ... /.../ as in ... /.../ fine, powdered
e) ... /.../ as in ... /.../ king

### 4. Position of Vowel Symbols with Clusters

Compound vowel symbols enclose both an initial superscript and its subscript, but are pronounced after the subscript, e.g. ... /.../ forest, ... /.../ left, ... /.../ to begin, ... /.../ to compare. The same is true with medial written clusters, even though the superscript represents the final consonant
of a preceding syllable, e.g.:

* ... /.../ to originate 
* ... /.../ pillar
* ... /.../ song
* ... /.../ increase

This rule results in a particularly complex spelling in the common word ...

* ... /.../ ‘now’.

### 6. Medial Clusters

#### a) One Subscript.

....

#### b) Two Subscripts.

Three consonant symbols are written vertically in medial position in a few words, in which case the first consonant is written as a superscript and the following two are written as subscripts in the order of their pronunciation. Almost all such words contain a medial phonological sequence consisting of a nasal as the final consonant of the first syllable, followed by a syllable whose initial consonant is a stop homorganic with the preceding nasal, plus /-r-/

* កញ្ជ្រោង /.../ fox
* កន្ត្រៃ /.../ scissors
* តន្ត្រី /.../ music
* សង្គ្រាម /.../ war

Three exceptions to this pattern occur in the following three loanwords:

1) ... (sometimes spelled អង់គ្លេស) /.../ (~ /.../) English
2) សំស្ក្រឹត (sometimes spelled ...) /.../ Sanskrit
3) សាស្រ្តាចារ្យ /sahstraacaa/ professor

### 7. Final Clusters

Many loanwords are spelled with an etymological final cluster, the subscripts of which are not pronounced, since only one consonant may occur phonologically at the end of a Cambodian word. Following are some common words spelled with final clusters:

* ... /.../ friend
* ពុទ្ធិ /put/ Buddha
* រដ្ឋ /.../ state
* ... /.../ menu
* ប្រពន្ធ /.../ wife
* ពាក្យ /.../ word
* ... /.../ doctor
* កម្ម /kam/ karma
* ... /bon/ merit
* ... /.../ heart, mind
* សត្វ /sat/ animal
* ... /.../ motor
* ... /sambot/ letter
* សមុទ្រ /samot/ ocean
* ... /.../ priest
* ... /.../ group, circle
* ... /.../ sun
* ... or ... /.../ province

If a final cluster has ... as superscript, they are both unpronounced, e.g.:

* ... /qaacaa/ teacher

However, when a word which is spelled with a final cluster occurs as the first element of a compound, the subscript is activated as the initial of a following syllable, e.g.:

* មិត្តភាព /.../ friendship 
* រដ្ឋាភិបាល /.../ government
* ពុទ្ធសាសនា /.../ Buddhism
* កម្មករ /.../ worker
