# Vowel Governance

As shown in Chapter II, the pronunciation of a vowel symbol is determined, or “governed,” by the series to which the initial consonant symbol belongs. However, in words with more than one initial consonant symbol, and in words of more than one syllable, the governance of the vowel series is more complex.

## A. Monosyllables

In longer words, the rule applies much less consistently. The following two examples are regular with regard to the rule.
