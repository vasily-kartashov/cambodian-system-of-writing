# The Vowel Symbols

## A. Names of the Vowel Symbols

Cambodian vowel symbols may consist of one or a combination of elements written before, above, below, or after the initial consonant symbol. The complex symbols should be learned as units, since their values may bear little relation to the values of their individual components. As was pointed out in Chapter III, B1, the pronunciation of a vowel symbol in Cambodian is determined by the series of the initial consonant that it accompanies. When referring to a given vowel symbol, Cambodians usually use the word ស្រៈ /sraq/ ‘vowel’ followed by the 1st series value of the symbol. These names are preceded phonologically by /q-/, since every syllable in Cambodian must begin with a consonant. In the chart that follows, the vowel symbols are listed in their dictionary order (in Cambodian dictionaries, words are ordered _primarily_ by initial consonant, _secondarily_ by vowel symbol). Each symbol is followed by its name, its 1st series value, and its 2nd series value.

## B. Values of Syllabic Configurations

The value of a given symbol may also depend on its environment; i.e. on the final consonant symbol that follows it in the same syllable, and on stress factors. Vowel sounds are also represented by the absence of a vowel symbol, by certain configurations of consonant symbols, and by various diacritics. It is thus clear that the Cambodian syllable must be read as a _configuration_. In the following chart, all the configurations by which vowels are regularly represented are listed in the order in which they occur in the official _Cambodian Dictionary_ of the Buddhist Institute (Bibliography Item 4), and each configuration is exemplified in both series.

  <tr>
    <th rowspan=2>Symbol</th>
    <th>1st Series</th>
    <th>2nd Series</th>

  <tr>
    <th>Value and Exemplification</th>

  </tr>

    <td>1. ...</td>
    <td>/.../ ... /.../ neck</td>
    <td>/.../ ... /.../ mute</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## C. The Independent Vowel Symbols

The independent vowel symbols are called ... /.../ ‘complete vowels’ because they incorporate both an initial consonant and a vowel. In the chart below, symbols 1-10 include an initial /q-/and are listed in the official dictionary along with other words that are spelled with an initial ... and the equivalent vowel symbol; e.g. words spelled with the independent initial vowel ...  /.../ follow words spelled with an initial ... /.../, Symbols 11 and 12 include an initial /r-/, and follow all words spelled with initial ...; symbols 13 and 14 include an initial /l-/ and follow all words spelled with an initial ....

Since the independent vowel symbols occur in a relatively small number of words, there is a certain amount of inconsistency in their use and pronunciation by Cambodians themselves, especially with examples 1-5 and 8-10 below. Some independent vowels, however, occur in quite common vocabulary items, such as number 4 in ... /.../ ‘father’, number 9 in ... /qaoy/ ‘to give’, and number 14 in ... /.../ ‘to hear’. Symbols 1-5 occur with both 1st and 2nd series values, but most frequently with 1st series values. In the chart below, the first value given for each symbol is the value that it has in the majority of the words in which it occurs. Less common values are shown in succeeding examples. Each symbol is followed by its equivalent spelling.

## D. Redundancy

In the preceding sections, it can be seen that the notation of Cambodian vowel sounds is “regular” in the sense that, given sufficient information about the environment of a vowel symbol, its pronunciation can be predicted; in other words, except where the independent vowel symbols are involved, it is seldom necessary to say: “sometimes pronounced --, and sometimes pronounced --.” (There are some irregularities, however, which are dealt with in Chapter X.) The Cambodian writing system does depart from the principle of a one-to-one ratio between sound and symbol in that a given vowel sound can be represented in a variety of ways. The following chart takes the vowel sounds as the starting point and shows the various ways in which they may be represented in the writing system. The regular, or typical, spelling is given first, followed by less typical spellings.

The consonant symbol ... is used as a base for 1st series syllables, and ... is used for 2nd series syllables.
