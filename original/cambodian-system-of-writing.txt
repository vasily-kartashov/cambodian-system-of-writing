PREFACE

The purpose of this book is to prepare the student to read and write Cambo-
dian. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the author's Modern Spoken
Cambodian (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1970) in an intensive or semi-in-
fensive beginning course. The phonological transcription used is that developed
during five years of study and teaching of the Cambodian language, and is identi-
cal with that used in Modern Spoken Cambodian. The book contains four parts:

Part One: The Cambodian System of Writing

This section presents a formal analysis of the relationship between the
sounds of modern Cambodian (the phonology) and the symbols used to represent
them (the writing system). It aims to acquaint the student with all the regular
aspects of the Cambodian writing system, as well as with the major irregular
subsystems. Although it is primarily intended for students, it has independent

interest to the general linguist as a description of how the Cambodian writing
system works.

Part Two: Programmed Reading Exercises

This section provides the student with a systematic, step-by-step approach

to reading and writing Cambodian syllables. It consists of 225 cumulative exer-
cises, each of which introduces and provides practice in a limited amount of new
information. Periodic review exercises provide a test of the student's progress,
and refer by number to exercises in which the points involved were first intro-
duced. Since the primary aim of this book is to develop facility in reading, most
of the exercises involve a symbol-to-sound operation. However, some of the exer-
cises involve a sound-to-symbol operation, since it is felt that the best way to help
the student recognize the sometimes minute differences between symbols is to have
him write them himself. This section is essentially a programmed approach to the
same information that is presented in Part One. Individual differences in learning
habits provide at least part of the justification for including both a summary and a
programmed approach in the same book.

Part Three: Beginning Cambodian Reader

This section consists of fifty reading selections graded in difficulty, ranging
from short simple narratives to essays on various aspects of Cambodian culture.
Each new vocabulary item is listed on the same page on which it first occurs, and
is followed by its transcription and definition. It is not entered again unless it oc-
curs with a different grammatical function. This section is designed to be used
following Part One and/or Part Two, and in conjunction with a course in spoken
Cambodian, but it would be independently useful for the student interested only in
reading. Its aim is to develop the student's reading ability to the point where he
can read unedited Cambodian texts with the aid of a dictionary.

Part Four: Cambodian-English Glossary

The Glossary includes not only the some 2,000 vocabulary items introduced
in the Reader, but also all examples used throughout the other sections of the book.
Each item is followed by its transcription, its definition(s), and the number of the
story in which it first occurred. The Glossary should also be useful to the stu-
dent as an aid in reading other Cambodian materials.

‘This book is an outgrowth of three years of study of the Cambodian language
at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London, in
Southeast Asia, and at Cornell University, and of two years of teaching Cambodi-
an at Yale University. It was prought to completion under a contract between
an U.S, Office of Education and Yale University, which is gratefully acknowl-
edged, Gratitude is also due the Department of East and South Asian Languages
eter iteratures of Yale University, which kindly granted me sufficient time from
teaching duties to complete the work.

Tt would be impossible to mention all those who have assisted in bringing
this work to completion. Thanks are especially due to Professor Fang-kuei Li
of the University of Washington, who first suggested the Cambodian languags 72
oO ield of study; Mrs. Judith M. Jacob of the London School of Oriental and ‘Atri-
a an Studies, who gave me the first practical introduction to Cambodian; Profes-
car Robert B. Jones of Cornell University, for his help and guidance durite the
preparation of a dissertation on Cambodian grammar, as well as for reading
prePaliticizing an early draft of this book; Mrs. Chhom-Rak Thong Lambert,
‘yho wrote and adapted all of the selections in the Reader; Mr. Im Proum, for
his painstaking work in writing all of the Cambodian script in two final drafts
of the book; and the Yale University Press, which dealt patiently with the many
problems of adapting a manuscript involving multiple writing systems to the
printed page.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. THE LANGUAGE

Cambodian, also known as Khmer, is the official language of the Kingdom of
Cambodia. It is spoken by some 5,000,000 people in Cambodia, and mutually in-
telligible dialects are spoken by approximately 400,000 inhabitants of the prov-
inces of Buriram, Surin, and Srisaket in northeastern Thailand, and by approx-
imately 450,000 people in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam.

Cambodian is the major modern representative of the Mon-Khmer language
family, which includes, besides Mon in Lower Burma, also hundreds of related
dialects scattered over most of mainland Southeast Asia, such as the Palaung,
Wa, and Riang in Burma; the Khmu, Lamet, and So in Laos; the Kuy, Chong, and
Lawa in Thailand; the Stieng, Biet, and Samre in Cambodia; the Bahnar, Halang,
and Sre in Vietnam; and possibly the Semang and Sakai in Malaya.1 No wider af-
filiation for the Mon-Khmer family has been conclusively demonstrated, although
most linguists now think that Vietnamese is related to Mon-Khmer. Pater Wil-
helm Schmidt’s hypothesis of an Austroasiatic language family on the Southeast
Asian mainland, including, besides Mon-Khmer, also the Munda languages of
northeastern India, Khasi in Assam, the Cham group in South Vietnam and Cam-
bodia, Nicobarese, and Semang and Sakai in the Malay peninsula,? is unwarranted
by present evidence, and his further grouping of Austroasiatic with the Austrone-
sian languages of island Southeast Asia to form an Austric superstock is even
more speculative, although many of Schmidt’s assumptions have been proven cor-
rect by later research.

‘As for foreign influences on the language, the Cambodians have borrowed
much of their administrative, military, and literary vocabulary from Sanskrit.
With the advent of Theravada Buddhism at the beginning of the fifteenth century,
Cambodian began to borrow Pali words, and continues to use Pali as a major
source of neologisms today. Although Cambodian and Thai are not, so far as we
know, genetically related, a high percentage of their vocabulary stems from a
common source, as the result both of mutual borrowing over a long period of
historical contact, and of common borrowing of learned terminology from Pali
and Sanskrit. During the period of French domination, many French words were
borrowed into the language and have become a part of the colloquial language,
especially in urban areas. There is also a smattering of Chinese and Vietnamese
loanwords in colloquial speech.

Unlike its neighbors Thai and Vietnamese, which are tonal and essentially
monosyllabic, Cambodian is non-tonal and has a high percentage of disyllabic
words. Like the Malayo-Polynesian languages, it has a relatively complex mor-
phology, forming disyllabic derivatives from monosyllabic bases by prefixation
and infixation, although these processes are rarely productive in the language.

4 Cambodian System of Writing

The typical stress pattern in such disyllables is an unstressed presyllable fol-
lowed by a stressed main syllable. Even polysyllabic loanwords from Pali and
Sanskrit tend to be assimilated to this pattern of alternation between an un-
stressed and a stressed syllable.

B. THE SYSTEM OF WRITING

The Cambodian script (called /qaqsaa kmae/ ‘Khmer letters’), as well as the
Thai, Lao, Burmese, Old Mon, Old Cham, and Old Javanese scripts, are all
derived from some form (or perhaps from various forms) of the ancient Brahmi
script of South India. The earliest form of this script so far discovered in South-
east Asia is that of the Vo-canh Sanskrit inscription of the second or third cen-
tury A.D., in the area of the old kingdom of Funan.3 The exact geographical
source in India of these scripts has not been determined, but epigraphers find
great similarity between the earliest inscriptions in Southeast Asia and those of
the early Pallawa kingdom of Kanchi on the Coromandel coast of India.4 The
earliest inscription in the Cambodian language is that found at Angkor Borei in
‘Takéo Province of southern Cambodia, and is dated 611 A.D.5 Since this inscrip-
tion was found in what would have been the area of Funan, the first known Indi-
anized kingdom in Southeast Asia (first century A.D. to c. 550 A.D.), and since

no vernacular inscriptions dating from the time of Funan have been discovered

in the area, Cambodian may have been the language of Funan. At any rate, the
fact that Cambodian was the language of Chen-La (550-802 A.D.), Funan’s suc-
cessor in the Mekong Valley, and of the great kingdom of Angkor (802~1431 A.D.),
whose suzerainty at its height extended eastward to the sea, northward to Tong-
king and northern Laos, westward to Burma, and southward to Malaya, is attested
by an abundance of stone inscriptions covering the period from the seventh to the
eighteenth centuries.6 Furthermore, the fact that pockets of speakers of Mon-
Khmer-related dialects are found all over mainland Southeast Asia seems to in-
dicate that Mon-Khmer in fact represents a much older linguistic substratum
which was later engulfed, partially assimilated, and pushed into the hills by suc-
ceeding migrations of Vietnamese, Tai, and Burmese.

Part One of this book is a description of the relationship, or the “fit?” between
the sounds (i.e. the phonological structure) of modern Cambodian and the symbols
(i.e, the written system) that are used to represent them. Writing systems differ
widely in terms of the closeness of the fit between sound and symbol; i.e. in the
regularity with which a given symbol represents a given sound. By this yardstick
the Cambodian writing system is a much better writing system than, for example,
that used to represent English. A description of the English writing system would
consist, after a nucleus of “regular” spellings, of an almost endless list of excep-
tions. An example of this confusing irregularity is the variety of sounds repre-

sented by the symbols -ough in the words rough, cough, bough, slough, and hic-
cough. The Cambodian writing system, on the other hand, represents the sounds
of Cambodian with remarkably little ambiguity, especially at the level of common
vocabulary.” There are exceptions, of course, especially at the level of learned
vocabulary borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali sources. These exceptions will be
dealt with as exhaustively as possible, but it would be impossible, even for as
regular a writing system as Cambodian, to list them all.

Although Cambodian spelling has historically been plagued by a lack of stan-
dardization, much progress has been made toward standardization in recent
years, largely through the efforts of the scholars of the Buddhist Institute, whose
excellent two-volume official dictionary — /waccenaanukram kmae/ ‘Cambodian
Dictionary’ (Item 4 in the Bibliography) — has been used as the authority for the
spellings in this book. Common alternative spellings are given for some words.

 

 

 

 

 

7. Assuming one is dealing with a homogeneous dialect; differences of
pronunciation from one dialect to another are another matter.
I. PHONOLOGY

In order to talk about the relationship between sound and symbol, one must
have an accurate description of the sound system of the language. The system
of transcription used herein was devised for use in the author’s Modern Spoken
Cambodian textbook, and represents the segmental phonemes of standard Cambo-
dian, which is taught in the schools and spoken by educated Cambodians. Although
some colloquial dialects, notably that of Phnom Penh and the immediately sur-
rounding area, differ considerably from the standard at the phonological level,
standard Cambodian is virtually identical with the dialect spoken by the majority
of the people in the central provinces, and is understood throughout the country.
If this book is used concurrently with Modern Spoken Cambodian, neither the
sound system of the language nor the transcription used here will present a prob-
jem to the student. For the sutdent who has no prior acquaintance with the sound
system, an attempt is made below at a phonetic description of the sounds repre-
sented by the transeription. Such descriptions, however, are at best approximate,
and it is recommended that the student have the examples listed in this section
pronounced by a native speaker if at all possible.

A. (CONSONANTS

‘The consonant phonemes of Cambodian are arranged in an articulatory chart
below. The terminology used in the chart is useful in later chapters in dealing
with the relationships between the writing system and certain groups of articula-
torily related consonants. It is also relevant to the arrangement of consonant
symbols in the Cambodian alphabet. Those symbols preceded by a hyphen occur
both initially and finally.

Voiceless unaspirated palatal stop. Initially like the ch in cheese, but
without the aspiration. Finally it represents an unreleased closure made
with the blade of the tongue against the front part of the hard palate.

 

Voiceless unaspirated velar stop. Initially like the k in key, but without
the aspiration; or like the k in ski. Finally like the ck in back. After the
vowels /ii, ei, ee, or ae/ it is intermediate between /c¢/ and /k/; the two
never contrast in that position.

 

Voiceless unaspirated glottal stop. Initially like the closure which occurs
at the beginning of the word Oh! when pronounced explosively. Finally like
the closure which occurs at the end of the first Oh in the exclamation Oh,
oh (he’s done it again!). Tiga

Voiced unaspirated bilabial stop. Like the b in bin, but more tense.
Voiced unaspirated dental stop. Like the d in day, but more tense.

Voiceless labio-dental spirant. Like the f in fool. Occurs only in a few
loanwords.

Voiceless dental groove spirant. Like the s in sit,

Voiceless glottal spirant. Initially like English h in hot. In final position
its point of articulation is much fronter, somewhat like the German ch in
Ich.

Voiced bilabial nasal. Like the m in mom, ham,
Voiced dental nasal. Like the n in no, on.

Voiced palatal nasal. Like ny in canyon, but occurs initially and finally in
Cambodian.

Voiced velar nasal. Like ng in sing, but occurs both initially and finally in
Cambodian. After the vowels /ii, ei, ee, ae/ it is intermediate between /i/
and /n/; the two never contrast in that position.

Voiced labio-dental semi-vowel. Spirantized in initial position, like the En-
glish v in voodoo, but with more lip-rounding. May be delabialized in final
position.

Voiced palatal semi-vowel. Like English y in you, but more tense.
Voiced lateral. Like English 1 in late, ale.
Voiced retroflex. May be slightly trilled initially, but usually pronounced

as a single flap, like the Spanish r in pero.
B, INITIAL CONSONANT SEQUENCES

Eighty-five two-place initial consonant sequences /CC-/and two three-
sequences /CCC-/ occur in Cambodian words. Their distribution is shown

below.

when the stops /p t c k/ occur as the first member of two-place initial conso-
nant sequences /CC-/, they are unaspirated before /xsh/, slightly aspirated be-
fore voiceless stops and all continuants other than /x/ (except in the homorganic
sequence /im-/), and released with slight vocalisim pefore /q b d/ and in the se-
quence /Iky-/. When the consonants /q m1/ occur as the first consonant of /CC-/
sequences, they are released with slight vocalism.

Cc. VOWELS

There are thirty-one different vowels and vowel combinations which occur as
vocalie nuclei of Cambodian syllables. These nuclei are here analyzed as consist-
ing of only thirteen vowel phonemes: ten short vowels and three short diphthongs.
In Chart 3 the arrows represent sequences of vowel phonemes (long diphthongs).
Tong vowels and long diphthongs, which are equivalent in length, are treated as
sequences of two short vowels. The long vowels /ee/ and /20/ have no short coun-
torparts. ‘The short diphthongs, which are equivalent in length to short vowels,
have no long counterparts, and so must be treated as unit phonemes, ‘They are
written with a breve to distinguish them from long diphthongs. ‘The following
nuclei occur:

10 long vowels: /ii, ee, €€, $4, 2, a2, aa, wu, 00, 90/

10 long diphtongs: /io, 42, ue, ei, 24, ou, ae, 29, 20, 20/
@ short vowels: /i, e, £, 2, a, 4, u, 0/

_3 short diphtongs: /é®, we, 62/

31 vowel nuclei.

el /aa/to the ear of a Cambodian).

D. WORD STRUCTURE

1. Monosyllables

The structure of monosyllables is shown by the formula Cy(C2)(C3)V1(V2)(Ca4),
with the limitation that if V2 doesn’t occur, then C4 must occur. In other words,
short vowels are always followed by a consonant in stressed syllables. Thus
monosyllables containing a short vowel or diphthong will have one of the follow-
ing three shapes; the third is rare.

1)CV¢_—/bat/ ‘to close’ /kit/ ‘to think?
2) CCVC /sdap/ ‘to hear’ /prob/ ‘male’
3) CCCVC /sthat/ (~ /that/) ‘to be located’

Monosyllables containing a long vowel or diphthong occur in the following five
shapes; the fifth is rare.

1) CVV. /xaa/ ‘work? /puu/ ‘uncle’

2) CVC /baan/ ‘to have’ /gaoy/ ‘to give’

3) CCVV — /chii/ ‘to be ill’ /psaa/ ‘market?

4) CCVVC /craon/ ‘much’ /sqaat/ ‘to be clean’
5) CCCVVC /sthaan/ (~ /thaan/) ‘place’ /Ushaon/ ‘drama?

Sequences of three initial consonants occur only rarely, and then C3 is always /h/.

2. Disyllables

Minor disyllables2 consist of an unstressed presyllable of shape CV+, CrV+,
CVN+, or CrVN+, followed by a stressed syllable. Minor syllables occur with
high frequency in Cambodian, and might almost equal the monosyllable in total
inventory if not in frequency. In minor disyllables the vowel of the unstressed
presyllable is usually reduced to /o/ in normal speech.

Examples: CVv+§$ /kakday ~ kokday/ ‘to scratch about’
Crv#§ /prakén ~ prokén ~ pokdn/ ‘to object?
CvNi$  /bankdot ~ benkdat ~ pekdet/ ‘to originate’
Crvn+8 /prambéy ~ prombéy ~ pombdy/ ‘eight’

Major disyllables consist of two stressed syllables in close juncture. Most such
words are compounds; some, however, are morphologically simple (as are the
first two examples below).

Examples: /siowphiw/ (~/sephiw/) ‘book’
/phieséa/ ‘language’
/biian-stien/ ‘to pray’
/sdiac-sdaen/ ‘insignificant’

 

2. My use of the terms “minor” and “major” disyllable differs somewhat
from that of Henderson in Eugénie J. A. Henderson, “The Main Features of Cam-
bodian Pronunciation,” Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 14
(1952), pp. 149-74.
12 Cambodian System of Writing

3. Polysyllables

Polysyllables are rare in colloquial speech, and can usually be identified as
loanwords from Pali, Sanskrit, or French sources. Words of up to six syllables
occur in formal speech, and even longer words occur in written texts. Such
polysyllables tend to conform in normal speech to the stress pattern typical of
disyllables; i.e. alternation of an unstressed with a stressed syllable.

Examples: Three syllables: /thoem+mo+daa/ ‘usually’
a Four syllables: /piitttotsh+snaa/ ‘Buddhism’
Five syllables: /rfoc+rdat+thda+phi+bdal/ ‘royal government’
Six syllables:  /witcdatre+ndq+ke+thda/ ‘editorial’

E. MARGINAL PHONEMES AND PHONEME COMBINATIONS

Certain marginal phonemes and combinations are introduced by French loan-
words which are not completely assimilated to the phonological structure of na-
tive Cambodian words.

Phonemes: /8/ in /Saek/ ‘check’ (Fr. cheque)
/2/ in /qaazii/ ‘Asia’ (Fr. Asie)
/g/ in /aanglei/ ‘English’ (Fr. anglais)

Combinations: /by/ and /eo/ in /byes/ ‘beer’ (Fr. biére)
I. THE CONSONANT SYMBOLS

A. NAMES AND VALUES OF THE CONSONANT SYMBOLS

There are thirty-three consonant symbols in the Cambodian writing system.
As in the Indic alphabet from which they are derived, they are arranged in five
groups based on position of articulation, proceeding from the back to the front of
the mouth, and a sixth group usually labeled Miscellaneous. These designations
are accurate for modern Cambodian, except that the ““Retroflexes” are pronounced
as dentals in Cambodian. In the chart below, the consonant symbols of Cambodian
are listed in their dictionary order, which should be memorized by the student for
efficiency in the use of dictionaries. Each symbol is followed by its name when
pronounced in isolation, and its values before a vowel, when first in a consonantal
cluster, and when in final position.

B. NOTES ON THE CONSONANT SYMBOLS

1. The Two Series

Notice that the names of some consonant symbols have the vowel /aa/ while
others have the vowel /00/, Consonants which are pronounced with an inherent

/aa/ vowel are called §§72557 AS; /qakhoosaq/ ‘voiceless’ in Cambodian, and

consonants which are pronounced with an inherent /00/are called £57 AS:
/ihoosaa/ ‘voiced’, based on the values which they had in the Indic writing sys-
tem.

‘These terms are not relevant to the phonological values of the two series of
consonants in modern Cambodian, since each consonant symbol has the same
phonological value as its counterpart in the opposite series. Thus we will refer
to them simply as the Ist Series and 2nd Series respectively. The distinction be-
tween the two series is essential to reading Cambodian, since the value of a fol-
lowing vowel symbol is determined by the series to which the initial, or “govern-
ing,” consonant symbol belongs. In other words, the Cambodian writing system
doubles the function of its vowel symbols by using two sets of consonant symbols
with a single set of vowel symbols. It follows that there are two consonant sym-
bols for every consonant sound, and two values for every vowel symbol. Thus
Cambodian has a syllabic writing system, in the sense that the pronunciation of
syllables is represented by configurations of symbols, as opposed to an alphabetic
writing system, where a sequence of symbols has a one-to-one relationship with a
sequence of sounds. This idea of configuration is strengthened by the fact that
yowel symbols are written before, above, below, after, and around the consonant
symbol after which they are pronounced.

1. The two series are sometimes also referred toas AS’ spr ) &
if 4
/samlein touc/ ‘small voice’ and Arey & /samlein thom/ ‘large voice’, or
° J 1
nd2873 as /samleiy sxaal/ ight voice’ and AFE78 {98 /samletn

tytien/ ‘heavy voice’ respectively.
16 Cambodian System of Writing

2, Conversion
Those ist series symbols which lack a counterpart in the 2nd series, name-
ly &f /baa/, AF /saa/, ty /haa/, and Hf /qaa/ can be “converted” to 2nd

series symbols by the addition of the diacritic Gah /txeysap/ (~) to the
1st series symbol, giving £5 /bo0/, AS /s00/, £A /noo/,and F$ /q00/, so
that a following vowel symbol is pronounced with its 2nd series value.2 Those
2nd series symbols which have no counterparts in the 1st series, namely §
Apo, 61 Joo, $F /mo0/, U5 /y00/, § /ro0/, and P ie can be con-

verted to ist series symbols by the addition of the diacritic wanes
/ruseakotdon/ (4), giving 3! /naa/, ” Vaca/uits) fraca/s 25° /saa/) 3

i
/raa/,and § /waa/, When a vowel symbol that is written above the consonant

i
symbol occurs with a converted consonant symbol, the /museakotden/ (—) and
/troysap/(“) are replaced by the #5 appar £5 /ibish kraom/ (~) under
YL
the consonant symbol; e.g. AS 485 /sii/ ‘to eat’, #8 > #58 /moin/ os 0007.
However, the /troysap/ is usually written above a converted £) or $$ despite
SS
a superscript vowel, although either form may occur; e.g. LA 4 ~ anh /riin/

NOY
‘a kind of toad’; $f ~ §§ /qii/ ‘an interjection’. In the dictionary, words
i

spelled with these converted symbols follow words spelled with their counter-
parts and having the same vowel symbol.
The /museqketcen/ is also used to convert the symbol £ /baa/ to o /paa/,

which does not otherwise exist in the 1st series. All words spelled with ss fol-
low all words spelled with £7 in the dictionary order.

3. The Symbol £% /baa/

When £ /b/ is followed by the vowel symbol —7_, it has the alternative
form 7 to distinguish it from £7 +4 andfrom £7 ; e.g. 7) 039 /baay/
Scosked vice Oey) |ijesay) “toevend) 27ee /may/  nersellil)?

The symbol 25 /b/ is pronounced /p/ in the following circumstances:

’
2. The /treysap/ should be carefully distinguished from the ASAS /saq/
() which occurs as an integral part of the symbols & , A, , &,H

§ , and FF.

a wy, 7
G? /paa/ father av /pey/ flute
b) When it occurs with a subscript:
iw \
££ /pdey/ husband £(B /oras/ to use
u
Such words follow words spelled with #5 in the dictionary.
¢) In some words an initial £7 is pronounced /p/ even though it is written
neither with the /museqkotdon/ nor a subscript. Such words are listed incon-
sistently in the dictionary, sometimes occurring among words spelled with an
iu
initial £7 , and sometimes among words spelled with initial £3 :
o

However, due to the homophony between Y and § in this position, such words
may be found spelled either way.

5. The Retroflexes
Since there are no retroflex consonants in Cambodian, the Retroflex symbols
are available for other uses. The symbols ©) and g are used to represent /d/
18 Cambodian System of Writing
in the 1st and 2nd series respectively, and the Retroflex nasal (V7 is used to
represent a ist series /n/, The symbols 1? /thaa/, & /doo/ and ca /thoo/
are rare, occurring only in a few words of Pali or Sanskrit origin.

6. The Aspirates

symbols 9 to & O45 ase BR , and &} , which represented

aspirated consonants in the script from which they were borrowed, represent se-
quences of a stop + /h/ in Cambodian. When they occur as the first member of a
written cluster, however, they represent the unaspirated stops /p t ¢ k/.

1. Final -9

Notice that when J /r/ occurs in final position, it is not pronounced (repre-
2
sented Gin the chart); e.g. ANS /kaa/ ‘work’, $89 /kmae/‘Cambodian’.

8. Special Combinations

SS
y) to represent the consonant /t/ e.g. £/) 7% /tok/ ‘to train’, AY EL) /kaatei/

counterpart of > seg. ID & /woun/ ‘flock, crowd’. £9 also sometimes com-
pines with the subscript forms of #5 /moo/, & /noo/, and QS /100/ to repre-
sent the Ist series counterparts of those symbols; e.g. £/) /maa/, /naa/,
and 4) /laa/.

C. THE TWO SERIES CONTRASTED

In the following chart, each consonant symbol is correlated with its counter-
part in the opposite series, and both forms are exemplified. Where possible,
the examples are words whose spellings differ only with regard to the initial con-
sonant in order to show the influence of each series on the value of a following
vowel symbol. The matter is treated fully however, in Chapter IV: The Vowel
Symbols.

Iv. THE VOWEL SYMBOLS

A. NAMES OF THE VOWEL SYMBOLS

Cambodian vowel symbols may consist of one or a combination of elements
written before, above, below, or after the initial consonant symbol. The com-
plex symbols should be learned as units, since their values may bear little rela-
tion to the values of their individual components. As was pointed out in Chapter
Ii, B1, the pronunciation of a vowel symbol in Cambodian is determined by the
series of the initial consonant that it accompanies. When referring to a given.

vowel symbol, Cambodians usually use the word (@@: /sraq/ ‘vowel’ followed

py the 1st series value of the symbol. These names are preceded phonologically
py /a-/, since every syllable in Cambodian must begin with a consonant. In the
chart that follows, the vowel symbols are listed in their dictionary order (in
Cambodian dictionaries, words are ordered primarily by initial consonant, sec-
ondarily by vowel symbol). Each symbol is followed by its name, its Ist series
value, and its 2nd series value.

B. VALUES OF SYLLABIC CONFIGURATIONS

The value of a given symbol may also depend on its environment; i.e. on the
final consonant symbol that follows it in the same syllable, and on stress factors.
Vowel sounds are also represented by the absence of a vowel symbol, by certain
configurations of consonant symbols, and by various diacritics. It is thus clear

1. The symbols for the diphthongs /uo, 19, ie/ (examples 22, 24, and 25 above)
have the same pronunciation with either series of consonants, so that words con-
taining these vowels are sometimes spelled both ways; e.g. /cion/ ‘to fry’ is some-

times spelled reaps and sometimes rQja 4

hme Gomemyendied Ne.
5

3, The symbol $ /réshmuk/ always represents a final /-b/, when it occurs
after long vowel symbols, it both shortens and changes the quality of the vowel, as
in examples 23, 28, 30, and 83 above; in example 39 it represents a short vowel +
final /-h/.
The Vowel Symbols 29
C. THE INDEPENDENT VOWEL SYMBOLS

The independent vowel symbols are called e

 

2869 HF /sxaq pit tuo/
‘complete vowels’ because they incorporate both an initial consonant and a vowel.
In the chart below, symbols 1-10 include an initial /q-/and are listed in the of-
ficial dictionary along with other words that are spelled with an initial $f and
the equivalent vowel symbol; e.g. words spelled with the independent initial vowel
®  /qo-/ follow words spelled with an initial 2 /q2-/, Symbols 11 and 12
include an initial /r-/, and follow all words spelled with initial J ; symbols 13

and 14 include an initial /1-/ and follow all words spelled with an initial as
Since the independent vowel symbols occur in a relatively small number of
words, there is a certain amount of inconsistency in their use and pronunciation
by Cambodians themselves, especially with examples 1-5 and 8-10 below. Some
independent vowels, however, occur in quite common vocabulary items, such as

number 4 in 8 6 /qewpuk/ ‘father’, number 9 in G /gaoy/ ‘to give’, and
number 14 in 4 /143/ ‘to hear’. Symbols 1-5 occur with both Ist and 2nd
series values, but most frequently with 1st series values. In the chart below, the
first value given for each symbol is the value that it has in the majority of the

words in which it occurs. Less common values are shown in succeeding examples.
Each symbol is followed by its equivalent spelling.

D. REDUNDANCY

In the preceding sections, it can be seen that the notation of Cambodian vowel
sounds is “regular” in the sense that, given sufficient information about the en-
vironment of a vowel symbol, its pronunciation can be predicted; in other words,
except where the independent vowel symbols are involved, it is seldom necessary
to say: “sometimes pronounced —, and sometimes pronounced —.” (There
are some irregularities, however, which are dealt with in Chapter X.) The Cam-
podian writing system does depart from the principle of a one-to-one ratio be-
tween sound and symbol in that a given vowel sound can be represented in a variety
of ways. The following chart takes the vowel sounds as the starting point and
shows the various ways in which they may be represented in the writing system.
The regular, or typical, spelling is given first, followed by less typical spellings.

‘The consonant symbol ®% is used as a base for Ist series syllables, and #5
is used for 2nd series syllables.

V. SUBSCRIPT CONSONANT SYMBOLS
A. SUBSCRIPT FORMS

When two consonant symbols are pronounced consecutively (without an inter-
vening vowel) within a word, the second (and sometimes, in medial position, a
third) consonant symbol is written in a special subscript form below the first
symbol. The form of the subscript is in most cases a smaller version of its su-

perscript counterpart, but without the ("ASA /saq/ ‘hair’ (not to be confused

with the /treysap/(~; see Chap. II, A 2) which adorns the top of seven conso-
nant symbols. Some subscripts, on the other hand, bear no discernible relation-
ship to their counterparts, and must be learned in addition to the basic super-

\
script forms. These subscripts are called IR Soo ns /ceen qaqsaa/ ‘conso-
nant feet’ in Cambodian, and the resulting consonantal groups are referred to as

B. NOTES ON THE SUBSCRIPTS

1, Shapes of the Subscripts
a) The subscripts 9  /khaa/, g /a00/, R /naa/, $9 /p22/, $f /aaa/

are identical in form with their superscript counterparts.
b) The subscripts  /kaa/, # /k09/, &% /caa/, & /chaa/, & /taa/,
nr A a 0 a

# /pho9/, B /phaa/, and 2 /haa/ are identical with their superscript

/
counterparts except that some small embellishment, usually referred to as AS
/soq/ ‘hair’, is omitted from top of the subscript: in the first six examples,

S inthe case of 4 /phaa/, and “— in the case of £7 /haa/.
c) The subseripts 2§97 /khoo/, A357 /choo/, 6957 _/thod/ are xeprodue-

tions of their superscripts whose final vertical strokes extend upward and end in
a “hook” on a line with the hooks of the superscript.

d) The subscripts oy /paa/, egy /y22/, Oy /saa/ are also charac-
terized by a right-hand vertical stroke which hooks on a line even with the top of

the superscript, but their subscript portions bear little resemblance to their coun-
terparts.

e) The remaining subscripts bear little or no formal resemblance to their

eee icine Ong aa a) 2
CoOwnG A a+ ~ d

£) The subscript G /x00/ precedes its superscript, e.g. @ /txoy/ ‘fish’.
g) When 97% /i100/ occurs as a superscript the — element is omitted, e.g.
2G Ss
£5 697) /baicio/ ‘to order’; when £ occurs as its own subscript, it takes the
an
full torm (7) , e.g. P67 /amhaa/ “young Indy’; otherwise it takes the form
Ar ee & »2> /praachaa/ ‘intelligence’.

2. The Subscript =
‘The subscript = serves as a subseript both for Q /eaa/ and % /taa/,

In initial sequences the subscript # is always pronounced /d/; e-g., Be
/pdey/ ‘husband’, {) /kdaa/ ‘plank, board’. Medially, however, its pronuncia-

tion is unpredictable. As a general rule, it is pronounced /d/ when it occurs as

a subscript to M7, and /t/ when subscript to & ; ¢.g., 27908 /bandoh/‘to
7
Subscript Consonant Symbols 37

grow, raise’; £382 /bantoh/‘to criticize”. In some words, however, it is also
pronounced /d/ when subscript to & ; e.g., Asta & 5 /sandaoh/‘to pity’;
ASg7& /sandaan/‘family, lineage’ Since = serves as subscript for both a
and $F , and $7 has no subscript form, there are only thirty-one subscripts,
compared with thirty-three consonant symbols.

8. Special Combinations

Certain special combinations of superscript plus subscript represent a single
phonological consonant rather than a sequence of consonants. They are:

a) py /laa/ asin 7) /laan/ car
G
ey /iaa/ ~ /waa/ as in aps /fok/ to practice, Be /wouy/ crowd
ce) 2p /naa/ as in Bh /non/ there, that’s it
=
Ele) /man/eabnyenes ust) tines pewdered
= =

e) gp /laa/ as in nS /luen/ king
nw yy
A
4, Position of Vowel Symbols with Clusters

Compound yowel symbols enclose both an initial superscript and its subscript,

' »Y ‘
but are pronounced after the subscript, e.g. /priy/ forest, ney Jewein/
left, P1525 /pdaom/ to begin, F @prs/orien/ to compare. The same is true with

medial written clusters, even though the superscript represents the final consonant
of a preceding syllable, e.g.:

Vy
ry gS /pankast/ to originate Pt 5.28903 /bankoot/ pillar
\
BP Gps /camriay/ song £3(@S8 /camran/ increase

This rule results in a particularly complex spelling in the common word 88 ge oe

(~ oe /geylow-nih/ ‘now’.

5. Initial Clusters

a) With a very few exceptions, all occurrences of initial written clusters repre-
sent two-place initial sequences /CC-/ phonologically. When one of the aspirated
38 Cambodian System of Writing

consonant symbols (9 , & ; ae ® , etc.) occurs as a superscript, it repre-

sents an unaspirated stop phonologically. Aspirated consonant symbols usually
cecur as superscripts in words where the subscript is a voiceless consonant or
a nasal, e.g.:

Be (oesn/ honse, _§ Pasom/ 1, Pg /ckae/ dog

/
Unaspirated consonant symbols usually occur as superscripts when the sub-

\
script is a voiced consonant or /r/s e.g., S77 AF /kbaal/‘head’, £8 /pdey/
atusbana’, /wrwu/‘teacher’, This difference in representing the same initial

consonant can be explained by the phonetic fact that in sequences of the first type,
the first consonant is usually pronounced with slight phonetic aspiration, while in
sequences of the second type the first consonant is usually unaspirated. These
differences are non-contrastive, however, from a phonological point of view; Le.
no two initial consonant sequences ever contrast phonemically with regard to as-
piration. The way in which initial consonant sequences are pronounced varies
from dialect to dialect, with the result that the phonetic differences are not con-

sistently maintained in the writing system. For example, Por /smae/ ‘Khmer’
is spelled with an aspirated initial, while rH /xmein/ ‘to be young’ is spelled

with an unaspirated initial, although the sequence /km-/ is phonetically identical in
the two words.

Thus while approximately 180 written sequences occur, there are only eighty-
five phonologically permissible /cC-/ sequences at the beginning of Cambodian
words.

b) When an initial cluster has an aspirated consonant symbol as subscript,
the cluster represents a three-place initial consonant sequence /ccc-/. Only

Q
three such sequences occur in initial position: As7S 675 /sthaanii/ ‘station’,
aN o
539 /mphiy/ ‘20°, oS /\khaon/ ‘drama’.

6. Medial Clusters

a) One subscript. An even wider distribution of superscript plus subseript
combinations occurs medially than occurs initially. The great majority of medial
clusters have only one subscript, although a few have two.

1) Medial clusters with nasal superscripts. The commonest source of
medial clusters are disyllables whose initial syllable has the shape /CVN-/ (Con-
sonant-Vowel-Nasal). In such words the final nasal of the first syllable is written
as 2 superscript, and the initial consonant of the following syllable is written as 2

subscript, With the superscripts SI, om ,ard & (or 09 ), there are

some limitations on what symbols occur as subscripts.
Subscript Consonant Symbols 39
When the superscript is #$ , the subscript will represent one of the con-
sonants /k r hw qf kh/, e.g.:

/ a
5% & /sankat/ division £58929 /payqaem/ sweets
v B
aM & /banhat/ to train BA /bankkham/ to enforce

When the superscript is (79 , the subscript will represent one of the con-
sonants /c ch i/ (i.e. will be homorganic): 5099 /baicam/ to pledge,

£5 OY, nye /bafichod/ to stand on end, ASeyy /saithaa/ sign
ae %

When the superscript is & (or OV? ), the subscript will represent one of
the consonants /dt th ly s/ wae /bantac/‘a little’, meats /sansasm/
‘dew’, asPops /sandaek/ ‘beans’, nigh /xanlaen/‘place’. However, when
the superscript is 9 , there are no limitations on the subscript; e.g.,

8529 07 /dambaaii/‘weaving’, 957 299) /kamdaw/‘heat’, papas /kameil/
‘laziness’, A985 # /sampat/‘confidental’.

In disyllables whose first syllable has the shape /CVm-/ the presyllable may
°
be written either with the /nigkshot/ — 1( sx semex9 /qaqsaa rioy/ ‘hori-

zontal letters’) or with the final - #7 as a superscript and the initial of the sec-
ond syllable as subscript ( a9 So /qaqsaa damruet/ ‘vertical letters’).

The following examples are spelled both ways:
° / 0 £3 y /
BOARS ~ MEFAS /Kampwoh/ height SSS ~ & B98 /tummion/ weight

s GY, /
Agp8 ~ 825% /damiowy/ potatoes SATAN ~ SBT /samsat/ sad
U

2g
The result is that such words are spelled first one way and then another by the
literate public. However, the trend seems to be toward more general use of the
More efficient /niqkehot/ spelling at the expense of the conjunct spelling. In the
official Cambodian Dictionary of the Buddhist Institute, the /nigkshat/ spelling is
usually recommended where two spellings are possible, with two notable excep-

tions: in words spelled with an initial # — , and in roughly half the entries

 

1, See Chapter IX, A 2e for pronunciation of this symbol.
40 Cambodian System of Writing

y

spelled with initial #5 — , the conjunct spelling is recommended: ssa
oY ‘& e

/ ° iG o
Ar (~ BY By & /sammat/ confidential, Arty (~ AIFF ) /samlaa/
es)

stew.

2) Geminate medial clusters. Medial clusters in which the subscript is a
repetition of the superscript are quite common. Such written clusters usually

QQ
represent doubled consonants phonologically: ARR OTES /\satteyueh/ fame,
2
essfexs /paccay/ contribution, rQmnayers /oannaalay/ brary, $9299
a

/thoommeadaa/ usual.

When the syllable final value of a consonant symbol differs from its syllable
initial value, such clusters represent two different but closely related consonants
phonologically, e.g:

may? ess /sapbaay/ (~ /sobaay/) to be comfortable

SPESEPPED AS /aaakéed-mehaesoy/ Ist royal wife, 27 477 /rihsey/ bamboo
A 5

Many medial clusters have an unaspirated stop symbol as superscript with the
homorganic aspirated stop symbol of the same series as subscript. Such clusters
usually represent the sequence /CCh-/ phonologically, e.g.:

Q\
HTM VUN 193/qatthaathibaay/ explanation £9569 /putthoo/ heavens!
~ 12

a) /macchaa/ fish (elegant) des /xsatthoa/ artifact
« V

Aspirated subscripts tend to be pronounced as unaspirated consonants when
they begin an unstressed syllable, e.g.:

5877 /qadkeraa/ letter Sf Mark /gattabat/ article, composition
a

Oy AM BF 8D /puttesahsnaa/ Buddhism
I

b) Two subseripts, Three consonant symbols are written vertically in medial
position in a few words, in which case the first consonant is written as a super-
Script and the following two are written as subscripts in the order of their pro-
nunciation. Almost all such words contain a medial phonological sequence consist-
ing of a nasal as the final consonant of the first syllable, followed by a syllable
ie se initial consonant is a stop homorganic with the preceding nasal, plus /-r-/

a
ae oon /xaeroon/ fox AEG Meantray/ scissors
Subscript Consonant Symbols 41

y
a(S /antroy/ musie As (985. /sankriom/ war
Three exceptions to this pattern occur in the following three loanwords:

1) ses Bs (sometimes spelled 9313 AI ) /aankleeb/ (~ /qanglee/) English
e

aN rN
2) A5 (BPs (sometimes spelled nS (Ae ) /sanskrot/ Sanskrit

3) an (Romy /sahstraacaa/ professor?

7. Final Clusters

Many loanwords are spelled with an etymological final cluster, the subscripts
of which are not pronounced, since only one consonant may occur phonologically
at the end of a Cambodian word. Following are some common words spelled
with final clusters:

\

Se /mit/ friend aS /cat/ heart, mind

a
a8 /put/ Buddha 88 /sat/ animal

Io
oo /root/ state ess — /ytion/ motor
Se ao
sogsyy  /monuh/ aFt7@ /sambot/ etter
Ge 2s /praption/ wife arts(e /samot/ ocean
onsgy /pieg/ word Geass /preehsan/ priest
Bovey /pect/ doctor Pay /wion/ group, circle

q

ais /kam/ karma FEST /qaatit/ sun

ss

i SON i

spay /bon/ merit or £98 /inact/ province

Ifa final cluster has § as superscript, they are both unpronounced, e.g.:
9). By) /qaacaa/ ‘teacher’.
However, when a word which is spelled with a final cluster occurs as the first

element of a compound, the subscript is activated as the initial of a following syl-
lable, e.

 

 

2, Examples 2 and 3 actually involve four phonological medial consonants, al-
though only two are written as subscripts.

VI. VOWEL GOVERNANCE

‘As shown in Chapter II, the pronunciation of a vowel symbol is determined,
or “governed,” by the series to which the initial consonant symbol belongs. How-
ever, in words with more than one initial consonant symbol, and in words of more
than one syllable, the governance of the vowel series is more complex.

A. MONOSYLLABLES

1, If both superscript and subscript belong to the same series, there is no prob-
ee cperscriot and subscript are Series 1; vowel is Series 1:

Ayres /kbaal/ head fags /sqack/ tomorrow 5878 /psein/ different

Both superscript and subscript are Series 2; vowel is Series 2:

° /
e739 /Imoom/ sufficient Ss /pcum/ to assemble #5765 /mnodh/ pineapple
— On st

2. If, however, the two consonant symbols belong to different series, the following
two rules apply:

1) Any stop or spirant takes precedence over any continuant in determining
the series of a following vowel. In other words, symbols representing the conso-
nants of Group I below dominate symbols representing consonants of Group I:

Group I - Dominant Group II - Passive
opt ec ee ccr rate nent)
bd Siac letcY;
oae h

a) In the following examples, the dominant consonant belongs to the 1st
series, so the vowel has its Ist series value.
Superscript is dominant, subscript is passive:

y
@ ftvey/tisn PQA /pnack/ section AS) /swaa/ monkey
st
Superscript is passive, subscript is dominant:

Bees /mhoup/ food ayrens /mdaay/ mother a8 /\qaa/ pretty
a

b) In the following examples, the dominant consonant belongs to the 2nd
series, so the vowel has its 2nd series value.
Superscript is dominant, subscript is passive:
2.
255. /klion/ be hungry $A /pneek/ eyes A) /knie/ together
~ = Ss

43
44 Cambodian System of Writing

Superscript is passive, subscript is dominant:
sagas /mteeh/ 2 pepper gas /meul/ needle
7

Since both consonant symbols in these examples belong to the same series, there
is no problem of governance; they are listed to provide contrast with the 1st
series examples in a) above.

2) When both superscript and subscript are dominant, the series of the vowel
is determined by the series of subscript. In the following examples, the super-
script is 1st series while the subscript is 2nd series, so the vowel has its 2nd
series value.

/ /
B /ptedh/ house BAF /sk6d1/ to know AY _/kpwoh/ to be high
In such words, only 1st series consonants occur as superscripts, since the
series of the vowel is always determined by the subscript.
B. DISYLLABLES
Both of the foregoing can be summarized in a single unified rule, which is

valid for all monosyllables, as well as for most disyllables, which contain pre-
vocalic consonants of differing series.

RULE: In any syllable which is preceded in the same word by consonants of dif-
ferent series, the series of the vowel will be determined by the last pre-
ceding stop or spirant.!

1. In the following examples involving disyllables, the dominant consonant of the
first syllable takes precedence over the passive consonant of the second syllable.

a) Cy is ist series, so the vowel of both syllables is 1st series:

2, VY
Gare /prayat/ to be careful Ee /varey/ cigarette
t ip
Grn feravat/ cxiss-crossea —_ Gg/EM? /sralai/ to ike
Red eee
fay a8 /kanlaen/ place RPONK2 /kamnaot/ birth
b) Cj is 2nd series, so the vowel of both syllables is 2nd series:

X :
@ pasts /prolim/ dawn Gs /tronum/ a perch

 

1, It should be understood that this rule as stated is merely a rule of pronun-
ciation which is pedogogically useful for reading Cambodian. Historically, of
Course, quite the reverse is true: it is the pronunciation of a word which “deter=
mines” how it is written.

®, In these examples, the Ist series pronunciation of the second syllable vowel

 

is also indicated by the Ist series symbols #F /laa/ and On /naa/, but the in-
formation is redundant.
Vowel Consonance 45

q
eS /kumnit/ thought Pe /tammion/ weight

In such words as these, of course, the problem of governance doesn’t arise,

since the initials of both syllables are 2nd series, with the consequence that the
vowels of both syllables are 2nd series. However, these examples do illustrate
the principle of “vowel harmony” which operates in disyllables whose second syl-
lable has an initial continuant.

2. In disyllables each of whose syllables begins with a stop or spirant, the vowel
series of each syllable is determined independently, consistent with the rule
stated above. The great majority of such words have a Ist series vowel in the
presyllable, regardless of the series of the 2nd syllable vowel.

a) Ist series vowel in both syllables:

PM Aress /kakaay/ to scratch about ae) /kaatei/ coffee

Gye /pracam/ assigned to est § /bankaet/ to originate
b) 1st series vowel in first syllable, 2nd series vowel in second syllable:
@ sens /pratech/ comtry Gio /racdoa/ coot

ngge /santwac/ fish hook oy /pamplii/ to illumine

In a few words having a 2nd series stop or spirant in the second syllable, vowel
harmony is maintained by requiring a 2nd series initial consonant in the first syl-
lable.

2,
$82 /totedh/ to flap about RFRA /coceek/ to discuss

Gps /trotuu/ distance from toes to fingertips

In a few non-harmonic disyllables, however, the typical order is reversed,
with a 2nd series vowel in the first syllable and a first series vowel in the second
syllable.

y Vy
$259 /robah/ thing & Pap s/ciondas/ stairs

3. Exceptions to the Rule
Tn some disyllables with an initial £/ in the second syllable, a 2nd series
consonant in the first syllable imposes its series on the second syllable; i.e.

£7 functions as a passive consonant.

S82 /tumhum/ size PLM & /tiohion/ soldier

Q
Pam — /wihie/ temple
46 Cambodian System of Writing

These words are sometimes written with a converted #4 jeg. PEA ;
thus conforming to the rule. In monosyllables, however, 2 is always domi-
nant, e.g, £4 /thon/‘papaya”

é

Conversely, in some disyllables (especially in some disyllables with initial
#J ), a normally dominant initial consonant in the first syllable fails to impose

its series on a following passive consonant:

Irregular Regular

x ey)
OTS /qanlee/ category (ct. Ee F /qanwaa/ to beg)

C. POLYSYLLABLES

In longer words, the rule applies much less consistently. The following two
examples are regular with regard to the rule.

1) S888) /caettonaa/ to like
2) $88  /weettonio/ miserable

In the first example, the syllable -6? is pronounced /-naa/ because of a pre-
ceding ist series § ; in the second example, — &) is pronounced /-nia/ be-
cause of a preceding 2nd series & . In the following two examples, however,

the first is regular, the second irregular:

1) ASA 97 L/sadkeraac/ century

2) MAW /aackkoriee/ independence (rather than the expected */qaekkoraac/).
VI. DIACRITICS AND PUNCTUATION

A. DIACRITICS
°
The following special symbols, with the exception of the /sraq qam/( — ) and
Q
the /reshmuk/ ( 2), are usually treated as diacritics ( Fan 9 8 /woanneyut/)

in Cambodian textbooks. The /sraq qam/ and /réshmuk/ are listed as vowel sym-
pols in Cambodian dictionaries (see Chapter IV, A), although in fact they represent
combinations of vowel+consonant. These diacritics typically have several designa-
tions depending on the level of speech employed. There is furthermore a certain
amount of confusion between them among literate Cambodians. Each symbol is
listed here by its common pedagogical name, followed by alternative designations.
Some of the following have already been encountered, but are included here for
completeness.

shortens the vowel of that syllable.

a) Ina syllable with no written vowel, it signals the short inherent vowel, i.e.

hol, /u/ before a labial consonant and /tie/ elsewhere.

B. PUNCTUATION

Although the common western punctuation marks, suchas. ,;:!?..., etc.
are being used in Cambodian writing with increased frequency, as a result of
French influence, there are a number of punctuation signs which are character-
istically Cambodian,

1. 2557 /klie/ space
ov

Cambodian words are not normally separated by spaces in closely knit syntac-
tic phrases or single-clause sentences. The /klie/ ‘space’ is used in a way
roughly analogous to the use of the comma in English, but is more comprehensive.
There are stylistic differences from one text to another, but space typically oc-
curs in the following situations:

a) between clauses within a sentence

b) between sentences in a cohesive group of sentences

c) after preposed adverbial words or phrases, such as “usually,” “today,”
“in that town,” etc.

d) before and after proper names

e) before and after numbers

f) before and after the symbols ¥ , > Y ary, and 25 ¢ (ex-
plained below) er ) ae

g) between coordinate words in lists

Se of the uses of the /klie/ are illustrated in the following sentence:
° Q VY VA Vor

Diacritics and Punctuation 55

2.999 fan! (4)

The /khan/, or agye /Ibah/, is the Cambodian full stop. Tt occurs less tre-
quently than the full stop in English (see 1 above). Although usage varies, the
/khan/ normally occurs only at the end of a paragraph, i.e. a single sentence or

several sentences dealing with a single theme or topic. Thus its occurrence
usually signals the start of a new theme or topic in the text that follows.

Q
3.299 Pane A978 /baariyaosaan/ or ogre /\bab/ ( Y/ )
The symbol Y/ is a full stop that implies more finality than the /khan/ above.
It marks the end of a chapter or an entire text.
4, rou /koo-mout/ ‘cow's urine’ ( OR )

The /koo-mout/ is a full stop symbol that, like the /baariyaosaan/ above,
marks the absolute end of a text. It is usually reserved for poetic or religious

texts. It sometimes occurs as the second part of the compound symbol Y@v4w—,
which is also called /paariyaosaan/.

/
s.Prrand /pneek moen/ ‘cock’s eye’ ( @ or @ )
The /pneck mdon/, also called the apases /sokotteneet/, is an embellish-

ment said to represent the trunk of the elephant-god Ganesha, which marks the
beginning of literary and religious texts.

6. Bons ormar /camnoc pii kuuh/ ‘two dots and a slash’ ( > )

°

The /camnoc pii kuuh/ is used in much the same way as the colon in English.
In addition, it characteristically occurs after the quotative particle By ( B92 )

\
/thaa/ ‘saying, as follows’ and the copulative @  /kii/ ‘that is’.
A horizontal line is written between the two circles in order to distinguish it easily
from the /réehmuk/ (2 ).
1. $5988) /leik too/ ‘the figure 2’ ( oi )
x
The /leik too/, more formally called $9? rp SAI 07) /qaameendit-
x

safihiaa/, indicates that the word (or phrase) after which it occurs is to be repeated.

The most common use of the /leik too/ is in the writing of reduplicative com-
pounds.

sap 44 /psety-psein/ various
56 Cambodian System of Writing
aa g /touc-touc/ small and numerous

In some cases a phrase rather than a single word is to be repeated. This can be
determined only by the sense of the preceding words.

sar esst: ‘APP MY /daoy lack, day lack/ separately

When the words at the beginning of one sentence are a repetition of those at the
end of the preceding sentence, they may be represented by the /leek too/, e.g.

the words 29 /ptedh kiom/ ‘my house’ in the following example:
7S :
BIR 2 8 TERT
Eee neh uP

/iom tiw ptedh khom; ptedh kiiom niw cit psaa/
P'm going to my house; my house is near the market.

8. Yar /lag/or 425 7 /peiyaal/

The /laq/, and less frequently the /peiyaal/, represent ‘et cetera’, and are
both pronounced /laq/ when encountered in a text.

9. ASE ee /sahaq-safifiaa/ hyphen (- )

The /sahaq-safiiaa/ is used, as in English, to indicate that a word has been
interrupted at the end of a line and is continued in the next. It is also used in
verse where the poetic meter requires that a word be divided between two mea-
sures. In addition, a hyphen is commonly written between an individual’s family
name (which is written first in Cambodian) and succeeding names, and some-
times (especially in names of Cambodian Chinese) between all the names.

A, NUMERALS

Cambodian numeral symbols were borrowed from the same Indic source as
the alphabet. Although Arabic numerals are well known, especially in urban
areas, as a result of French influence, the Indic symbols (identical with those

‘Aithough the symbols themselves are based on the decimal system, the names
underlying them reveal an older system based on five, as can be seen in the names
of the numerals 6-9, which are 5+1, 5+2, 5+3, and 5+4 respectively. The
names of the numerals 1-9 and zero are as follows:

B. NOTES ON THE NUMERALS

1, In Cambodian numerals involving four or more symbols, a period is placed
after every three symbols, counting from the right to the left (as in French). This
system of punctuation has little relevance to the pronunciation of Cambodian nu-
merals, however, since each succeeding numeral is read as a separate denomina~
tion, rather than in groups of three. Such additive components, except in numbers
smaller than 100, are typically separated by rising intonation (represented by a
comma in the transcription). This rising intonation never occurs in compounds
separated by close juncture (represented by a hyphen in the transcription),

rw on ehes. 0 Bee

/pii-lion, bey-saen, pram-mein, buen-poon, prampil-rooy, haasop-pram/
2,000,000 + 300,000 + 50,000 + 4,000 + 700 + 55 (= 2,354,755)

No punctuation is used, however, in writing dates; e.g., 62-9604
1914-1918.

2. In multiplicative compounds whose first element is #7255 /muey/ ‘one’,
/muoy/ is usually shortened in rapid speech to /mo-/.

900 /musy-rosy/ ~/merooy/ 100
©.000 /musy-pden/~ /mepdon/ 1,000

This reduced form almost always occurs in bs /mephiy ~ mphiy/ ‘20? (re-

flected in the conjunct spelling), but /musy-phiy/ has been observed in deliberate
speech.

3. The ordinal forms of Cambodian numerals are formed by placing the ordinaliz-

ing particle § /tii/ in front of the cardinal numerals above, in either their
written or symbolic forms.

y Q y . :
SAS I AFTER (® one) /tii-saamsop-buen/ thirty-fourth

4, In addition to the numeral system outlined above, reflexes of Sanskrit numerals
oecur in many compounds, with either cardinal or ordinal meaning; e.g.?

£8 /cattog/ tour + es foot = £89096 /cattobaat/ four-tooted
a0 /pancag/ five + pyar /sel/ precept = aon ee /paiicasel/ the

five precepts.

C. ABBREVIATIONS!

The use of abbreviations is not as common in Cambodian as in western lan-
guages; e.g., there are no established abbreviations for the names of months.
Dictionaries and other technical works tend to coin abbreviations as needed; the
official Cambodian Dictionary contains a long list of abbreviations for use in giv-
ing information about lexical entries, many of which are found in other dictio-
paries, and many of which were invented ad hoc. In addition, the following ab-
breviations are relatively standardized.

 

1. Dates

In Cambodian dates the Christian era is generally used for most publications.
However, the traditional Buddhist era is used in older publications and in religious
texts, and in many publications both are used concurrently. The Buddhist era is
reckoned from the year of the death of the Buddha, usually considered to be the
year 543 B.C, Thus, when confronted with a Buddhist era date, subtract 543 years
to obtain the Christian era equivalent, ¢.g., B.E. 2510-543 = A.D, 1967. The two
eras are abbreviated as follows:

BS. BRIN rR /puttosagkeraac/ Buddhist era
#83 -= G@ASASAML — /krihsagkoraac/ Christian era

When a date is written in its full form, the day of the week precedes, followed by
the day of the month, the month, and the year, as in the following example:

Peres Noe 9 mas, O69 cf

/tyay-put tii-mephiy-btien méegkeraa krihsaqkeraac muey-pden prambuen-rooy
hoksep-pramboy/
Wednesday, the twenty-fourth of January, 1968.

Dates may be numerically abbreviated, however, in which case only the day, month,

1. The author is indebted to Tonkin, Modern Cambodian Writing (Bibliography
Item 30), for many of the abbreviations included in this section.
62 Cambodian System of Writing

and year are indicated by numerals only, separated by a hyphen. The above date,
in its shortest form, would be:

Wee 9-06 b of
2. Currency

The Cambodian monetary unit is the $$fas /riol/, which is divided into 100
&Aseg /sein/ ‘cents’. In accounting, sppas is abbreviated § , which is

written between the riels and the cents as follows:

500 /saesep-pram riol/ forty-five riels.
In columns of figures, the may be written only in the top figure and is replaced
in succeeding figures by a period or a comma.

#900 45 riels
om%,o0 35 riels
Sometimes both a comma anda superscript § are written:

0 45 riels

Sometimes the & occurs after the cents figure:

&oos 45 riels

D. PAGINATION

The great majority of Cambodian publications use Cambodian numerals for
numbering pages in the main body of a book, usually at the top center and set off

9-, -W- 1 -M-,-We- ,ete. Arabic numerals

are very rarely used for pagination, except in some bilingual publications. For
the pagination of material preliminary to the main body of a book, and for listing
major headings within a chapter, the consonants of the alphabet are used in their

dictionary order,e.g. AP , 9, 8, or , 9, , & , etc. These
may in turn be followed by subheadings listed by numerals, in the following pat-

by dashes: —

i UNWRITTEN SOUNDS

A. UNWRITTEN VOWELS

In the Cambodian writing system certain vowels are indicated by the absence
of a vowel symbol in specific environments. Although the following general rules
are valid for the great majority of cases, there are some exceptions and ambigui-
ties, especially in learned or unfamiliar vocabulary.

1, The Long Inherent Vowel (/aa/o0/)

a) Any stressed syllable which is to be pronounced with the long inherent vowel
(/aa/ after a 1st series symbol, /00/ after a 2nd series symbol; see Chapter IV,
B) is written with the initial consonant symbol alone, with or without a following
final consonant.

& /taa/ to continue a /k90/ dumb
prs /\gaa/ pretty sss /choo/ to stand
8 — /caat/ to moor oP = /ro0k/ to seek

@Ats /prakaap/ tocombine  agashy/lolook/ dove

Since individual words are not separated in the Cambodian writing system, it is
sometimes impossible to determine from the writing system alone whether a con-
sonant symbol represents the final consonant of the preceding word or a separate

y
word; for example F£5A may be read either as /baok/ ‘to open’ or as /bao kaa/
“if (the) neck’. Such ambiguities are almost always resolved, however, by context.

b) In any disyllable whose initial syllable may be pronounced in a reading pro-
nunciation with the long inherent vowel, no vowel symbol is written. Such un-
stressed presyllables are pronounced in normal speech with the short vowel /a/
or /2/ (depending on the series of the initial consonant symbol), and in rapid
speech with the vowel /2/. Presyllables containing a single initial consonant usual-
ly consist of a consonant which is a reduplication of the initial of the stressed sec-
ond syllable, although the consonants /m r 1/ also occur as initials of non-redupli-
cative presyllables. Presyllables containing two initial consonants consist of the
clusters /pr-, tr-, cr-, kr-, or sr-/ (with pr- most common), with /r/ written as

a subscript G I

¢) Inpolysyllabic words, when the consonant symbols £7 /baa/ and & /m09/
occur initially and before a following -¥-/r/, they are pronounced with their in-

herent vowels, long in careful speech and short in colloquial; before other conso-
nants, the short vowels /a/é/62/ occur (see 3 below).

LPT /moorekat ~ morekat/ emerald

2, The Short Inherent Vowel (/a/u/1i9/)

a) Any sequence of two consonants without an intervening vowel symbol, the
’ q
second of which carries a eh /bantag/ ( — ) is pronounced with the short

inherent vowel: /a/ after 1st series initial consonant symbols, and, after 2nd
series consonant symbols, /u/ before a labial consonant, and /i@/ elsewhere.

se /bat/ to turn
nner /chup/ to stop
ask /iiea/ to sell
b) Some words contain sequences of two consonant symbols which are pro-

nounced with the short inherent vowel even though the second symbol does not
carry the /bantaq/. Such words constitute exceptions to rule 1-a above, since

1, This word is sometimes written conjunctively i Apy , implying that the

first two consonants are pronounced as a cluster /mnuh/, which may in fact be
the case in rapid speech.
66 Cambodian System of Writing

such spellings normally indicate the long inherent vowel. Some of the commonest
words with this spelling are listed below:

éses /sam/ proper arbi /sapkum/ society

se /sap/ corpse Grd /praakat/ exact

RS  /ciien/ people RB /ciedag/ Jataka
Q

s8 — /riat/ car £39509 /piphup/ world

c) A few stressed syllables that are spelled with a silent final subscript but
no /bantaq/ are pronounced with the short inherent vowel. (Most words that have
this spelling, however, are pronounced as if they were written with a short

=74 | see section 3-a.) Some common words of this kind are listed below.
50 /sop/ every @enn$s/orcsn-say/ priest
aby /anion/ circle, family (Fe & /prapion/ wife
4) In all disyllables whose first syllable has no written vowel but ends in a
nasal c> isonant symbol, the first syllable is pronounced with the short inherent
vowel (with certain exceptions as shown in section 3-c below) with distribution as
described in 2-2 above. In such presyllables, as in those described in section

1-b above, the vowel is reduced in rapid speech to /a/,

3, The Short Vowels /a/éo/co/

All other syllables involving unwritten vowels are pronounced as if they were

/
written with the short vowel symbol -?-—- ; i.e. /a/ after a 1st series consonant
symbol, and /é9/ or /o8/ after a 2nd series consonant symbol (see Chapter VII,
A1b for distribution).

a) Stressed syllables that are written with a silent final subscript but no vowel
symbol are typically pronounced as if they were written with the vowel symbol

1
=9~-. . (A few such words, however, are pronounced with the short inherent

vowel; see section 2-c above.) Some of the more common words of this type are
listed below.

Q
ong /han/ the symbol APIBPE /sambat/ possessions

b) In words of more than one syllable (other than the types already discussed
in sections 1 and 2 above), consonant symbols with no written vowel are pro-
nounced as separate syllables with the vowel /a/ or /é/ (depending on the series)
when stressed, and /o/ when unstressed. When stressed, such syllables are pro-
nounced with an unwritten final glottal stop /-a/; i.e. /-aq/ and /-ceq/.

‘The stressed finals /-aq/ or /-oq/ are sometimes indicated in the writing sys-

tem by the use of the /yugkeléeqpintug/ (: ) when they occur in a final syllable,
or preceding an internal juncture within a compound (see Chapter VII,A 9 b):

as: /thurcoq/ preoccupation
re: /ihaanag/ position

#3 0xn: P59 AD3/konag-kammokaa/ commission

is pronounced in learned speech as an independent syllable may be pronounced in
more colloquial speech as the final consonant of the preceding syllable:

es Bs /pathamag/ ~ /patham/ first
upmosng /yaqkeléeqpintug/ ~ /yugkvélpintug/ the symbol -:

c) In some words whose second consonant symbol serves as the final of the

In many words of more than one syllable, a medial consonant symbol serves
poth as the final consonant of one syllable and the initial consonant of the next;
phonologically the consonant is doubled, and the extra syllable, if no vowel is
written, is pronounced with the short vowel /a/és/ (depending on the series) if
stressed, and /o/ if unstressed. (See section A 3 b)

X. IRREGULAR SPELLINGS

In the preceding sections we have been dealing primarily with the “regular”
aspects of the Cambodian writing system, in the sense that the pronunciation of
any symbol or sequence of symbols could be unambiguously predicted, given suf-
ficient information about the environment of the symbol, or about the composition
of a constellation of symbols. The purpose of this section is not to provide an
exhaustive list of irregularities, such as those found in only one or two words,
put rather to point up irregular spellings which occur in enough words to consti-
tute “sub-systems” of the writing system. The first three irregularities below
have already been encountered in the preceding chapters, but are included here
to provide an inventory of the major sub-systems.

1, /a/u9/ instead of /aa/o0/

Some syllables spelled with a sequence of two consonant symbols are pro-

nounced with a short vowel /a/ or /ti9/, rather than with the expected long /aa/
or /02/ (see Chapter IX, A 1 a).

Oss /sam/ proper (cf. Asf /saam/ fork)

58 /rist/ car ae

/roak/ search for)
2, /a/tia/ instead of /a/éo/da/

Some syllables spelled with a sequence of two consonants the second of which
has a silent subscript, are pronounced with the short inherent vowel /a/ or /1ia/,
rather than the usual /a/, /ce/ or /o9/ (see Chapter IX, A 3 b).

AY /sap/ every (cf. Bo, /sap/ sound)
eerg — /yiion/ motor (cf. es /yéeq/ demon)

3. Exceptions to the Governance Rule

As a rule, the pronunciation of a vowel symbol is determined by the series of
a preceding dominant consonant symbol (see Chapter VI, B). In some disyllabic
and polysyllabic words, however, a passive 2nd series consonant symbol does not
yield to a preceding dominant 1st series consonant symbol.

03 /acrin/ hammock (ct. ss /qanwaa/ to beg)

SARs /gaekkoriec/ independence (cf. AIAN /sagkoraac/ era)

In some disyllables whose second syllable begins with the normally dominant 1st

series £7 , the £9 is dominated by a preceding 2nd series consonant symbol.

XI WRITING

A, HANDWRITING

Cambodians take great pride in their writing system, and penmanship has tra-
ditionally been highly valued as a discipline in the schools, and especially in the
curriculum of the pagoda schools. The Cambodian script lends itself easily to
flourish and embellishment, as is evidenced by the variety of styles in common
use, and a carefully written text is aesthetically quite pleasing.

In careful writing, the following conventions are observed:

1, Symbol Composition
Individual symbols are drawn, where possible, in a continuous motion from
left to right. Superscript elements, called /saq/‘hair’, suchas S , © ,#_,

are added second. Short horizontal strokes are added last.

The vowel symbol ~? or ay , in both written and printed styles, is usually
attached to, or written as a continuation of, a preceding consonant symbol.

a) In consonant symbols surmounted by a /saq/( “ ), the /saq/ is extended
and attached to a following ~9 , as follows:

A> kaa, AY kio, HY caa, @BY chaa, HY taa, HM thie, A) phic

b) The sequence £7 + is written £/2 /baa/ to distinguish it from the
Sequence £¥? /caa/ (shown above), andfrom £9 /haa/.

c) ~9 is written as a continuation of the preceding consonant symbol in the
following sequences:

2559 khio 6057 thie e557 yio Faia laa
©) cio tie rie J5) gaa
0557 chia &) nie as lia

 caa 15? mie 5? saa

d) -9 is attached to the following consonant symbols:

2 wie OM naa 8) phaa im haa
ON jie ®?  thaa

ow;

3. Word Composition

In composing words, all “on-the-line” symbols, whether consonants or vowels,
are written in a sequence from left to right. In vertical combinations, first all
subscript symbols, and then all superscript symbols, are added before proceed-

ing to the next “on-the-line” symbol, except for the vowel symbols —) , -7?,

a
or $—  , which are completed before writing the subscript. The sequence of
writing steps is shown in the following examples:

Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5
y
ne g /pdey/ husband
/
2) 89 au 59 aes ay /sdap/ to hear
3) 25 wo ah oh pb /baykhouc/ to ruin
> Ya, ey
4) 28 oe us wider /pankast/ to origi-

nate

A /caen r00/ EC is added after the consonant, or consonant + “2 , to

which it is subscript, and before a superscript vowel, and is usually drawn large
enough to include a subscript consonant symbol. When it is not the initial ele-
ment in a word, a small space is left preceding the consonant symbol to which it
is subscript to accomodate its later addition, as in the following examples:

Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5
y

3) AS & 6 &s(e) AS (e905 BS (£59 25 /samrap/ for

B. STYLES OF SCRIPT

There are two basic styles of script in modern Cambodian: senpsrGpe
/gaqsaa crien/ ‘slanted script’, and TE ee /gaqsaa muul/ ‘round script’.
The first is by far the more common, and is used for running texts in publications
of all kinds, such as novels, textbooks, and newspapers. A variation of this,
sore 955 /qaqsaa choo/ ‘standing script’ is simply a vertical form of the
slanted script, and is used for chapter headings or subtitles, and in some publica-
tions replaces the slanted script entirely. The second style, /gaqsaa muul/, is
more archaic and much more elaborate. While most of the letters are similar in
shape to their slanted counterparts, afew, notably AP /kaa/, #3 /y00/, &
/n99/, and & /to0/, have entirely different shapes, and must be learned by the

student in addition to the basic slanted forms. This elaborate script is used for
titles of books, major headings, newspaper headlines, religious texts, proper
names, and inscriptions on public monuments and buildings. /qagsaa muul/ also

has a variant, BPS TS OTS /qaqsaa khaam/ ‘ Cambodian script’, which differs

from /muul/ only slightly, but which seems actually to be in more common use
than /muul/, although both forms are commonly referred to as /muul/ by the
general public. These four styles of script can be compared in the following con-
cordance.

D. TYPEWRITTEN STYLE

Cambodian typescript is currently available from only three companies: Adler,
Olympia (both of West Germany), and Varitype (U.S.A.). Both Adler and Olympia
use the keyboard designed by Mr. Keng Vansak, Dean of the Faculty of Letters in
Phnom Penh. This keyboard is less than satisfactory from several points of view:
the style is far less pleasing than almost any style of printed Cambodian in com-
Writing 81

mon use; since Cambodian consonant symbols vary greatly in width (e.g. § vs.
ass ), the necessity of assigning each symbol the same amount of space on the

keyboard results in highly artificial spacing; and there are not enough keys on a
standard keyboard to accommodate all the different elements of the Cambodian
writing system, so that many symbols must be composed of elements which do
double or triple duty. The style used by the Varitype machine is more satisfac-
tory from an aesthetic point of view, although the subscript consonants are un-
naturally small; the major difficulty is that the Varitype machine is designed to
accommodate many different writing systems by installing a different bank of type
for each language. The great number of different elements in the Cambodian
writing system make it necessary to use two banks, or hemispheres, so that it
is necessary to rotate the banks while typing, sometimes in the middle of a word,
making it a very cumbersome and time-consuming procedure.

‘The sample shown below was typed on an Adler machine; the text is the same
as that used in the handwritten samples in C above.

E. SAMPLES OF PRINTED STYLES

Cambodian publications use a great variety of attractive and artistic printed
styles. Samples 1-5 below illustrate the first five consonant symbols of the Cam-
podian alphabet in slanted, standing, Cambodian, round, and shaded Cambodian
styles respectively. Sample 6 is the standard slanted script (/qaqsaa crien/)
which is used for running text in newsprint and most books. Sample 7 illustrates
the standing script (/qaasaa choo/) which is used in subheadings and running text
in some books; e.g.,Volumes I-IV of the Buddhist Institute’s Collection of Cam-
podian Folktales (Item 5 in the Bibliography) are printed entirely in this standing
Samples 8 and 9 are in Cambodian style (/qaqsaa khoom/), which is gen-

erally used for titles, proper names, and inscriptions on signs and public buildings;
although it is technically /qaqsaa khoom/, it would be referred to by the generic
term /muul/ by the general public. Samples 8-15 were all taken from the weekly
publication /nédq ciet niyum/ (‘The Nationalist), which illustrates the great variety
of display styles that may occur in @ single publication.

‘The text of each sample is transcribed and translated below as an aid to the
student in reading the unfamiliar styles of script.

Cambodian System of Writing
I. INTRODUCTION

Part One of this book presents a formal analysis of the relationship between
sound and symbol in modern Cambodian. The purpose of this section is to pro-
yide the student with a step-by-step introduction to reading and writing Cam-
bodian words. Each exercise introduces a small amount of new material. The
exercises are cumulative, building on and reinforcing points that have already
been introduced. Periodic review exercises provide a test of the student’s prog-
ress, and refer by number to the exercise in which each point was first intro-
duced. The student should go back and review the exercise dealing with any
point in the review exercise with which he has difficulty.

Since the primary aim of this section, and indeed, of the entire book, is to de-
velop facility in reading, the great majority of the exercises involve a symbol-to-
sound operation. However, some of the exercises involve a sound-to-symbol op-
eration (much less predictable in Cambodian), since it is felt that the most effec-
tive way to help the student recognize the sometimes minute differences between
symbols is to have him draw them himself.

As in Part One, it is assumed that the student is familiar with the transcrip-
tion system used in the author’s Spoken Cambodian, of which a summary is pre-
sented for convenience below.

However, if the student is unfamiliar with the sound system of spoken Cam-
bodian, or if he intends to use this section without the aid of a native speaker, he
should read carefully the chapter on Phonology in Part One. To use this section
effectively, the student should follow these directions:

1) Cover the answer to each exercise (marked A.) with a blank sheet of paper.

2) Write the answer called for on the paper, and pronounce it aloud.

3) Check your answer against the correct answer which follows each exercise.

4) If you have made a mistake, practice the exercise until you can do it cor-
rectly from memory.

Il. CONSONANTS
1. There are 33 consonant symbols in the Cambodian writing system. How

2.

many different consonant sounds are there in the Cambodian language (refer
to Phonological Summary)?

A, 18

Thus there are about twice as many consonant symbols as are needed to
represent the consonant sounds of the language. In fact there are two ways
to represent every consonant sound, so that there are actually two series of
consonant symbols in the Cambodian writing system. The pronunciation of

a vowel symbol is determined by the series to which the preceding consonant
symbol belongs. Every vowel symbol then has values or pronuncia-
tions.

A. 2

| When a consonant symbol is written alone, with no accompanying vowel sym-

bol, it is pronounced with an “inherent” vowel. The inherent vowel with which
Ist series consonant symbols are pronounced is /aa/, The first letter of the

Cambodian alphabet is FS . It is a Ist series consonant which represents

the sound /k/, Write, transcribe, and pronounce the symbol *% with its in-
herent vowel.

A. FS kaa

. When a 2nd series consonant symbol is written with no accompanying vowel

symbol, it is pronounced with the “inherent” vowel /00/. The 2nd series con-
sonant symbol representing /k/ is * . Write, transcribe, and pronounce it.
A. BF koo

‘The initial consonant sequences /Kkh-, ch-, th-, ph-/ are represented by unit
symbols, although phonologically they are clusters. The ist series symbol
for the cluster /kh-/ is 9 . Write, transcribe, and pronounce it.

Consonants 89

a

The 2nd series symbol for /kh-/ is 2£* . Write, transcribe, and pronounce
it.

A, 295 khoo

All nasal symbols (except $4 /n/), when unmodified, are pronounced

with the 2nd series inherent vowel, and are classed as 2nd series conso-
nant symbols. (The conversion of nasal symbols to 1st series will be dis-

cussed later.) The symbol for the velar nasal /y/ is B . Write, tran-
scribe, and pronounce it.

A. 00

You have now been introduced to the first five letters of the Cambodian al-
phabet. They are: A 9 #f 195 73. The Cambodian alphabet is

divided into five groups, based on position of articulation, proceeding from
the back to the front of the mouth, and one residual group usually labeled
miscellaneous. The letters in the group above are all Velars. Within each
articulatory group, the order of letters is as follows:

1st series unaspirated consonant symbol (#} )
1st series aspirated consonant symbol (9)
2nd series unaspirated consonant symbol ( #9 )
2nd series aspirated consonant symbol (255)
2nd series homorganic nasal ( & )

Write, transcribe, and pronounce the Velar series above.

A. kaa, 9 khaa, ASkoo, 185 khoo, 8 noo

Every vowel symbol (with the exception of three, which will be discussed
later) has two pronunciations, depending on the series of the initial conso-

nant. In spelling a word aloud, however, Cambodians usually refer to vowel
symbols by their lst series values, regardless of the series of the preced-

ing consonant. The vowel symbol —% is called /sraq qaa/ ‘the vowel qaa’.
Its first series value is /aal/, A+ 9 is written A) . Write, tran-
scribe, and pronounce it.

A. AD) kaa

The second series value of —? is /io/, #8 + 9 iswritten AY .
Write, transcribe, and pronounce it.

The symbols 17 /daa/, 2? /thaa/, 9 /doo/, baF /thoo/, OM

/naa/ are referred to as the Retroflexes, based on their values in the Indian
writing system from which the Cambodian writing system is derived. Their
position of articulation is not retroflex, however, but dental. They follow the

Palatals and precede the “true” Dentals in the alphabetical order. 3 and

¢a§ are rare, occurring in only a few loanwords. (Mv) is the only nasal

Iv. FINAL CONSONANTS

According to the Phonological Summary, what consonants occur in final
position in Cambodian syllables?

A. p,t, c, k, a, h, m, n, f, 0, w, y, andl

What consonants never occur finally?
A. b, d, f, s, and r
Nevertheless, almost all the consonant symbols are used to represent final

consonants in Cambodian words, so there is much more redundancy in the
representation of final consonants than in initial consonants. Although many

words are spelled with a final § , itis not pronounced. However, it some-

times serves to distinguish orthographically between homonyms (see Part
One, Il, D). Transcribe and pronounce the following:

PY POF =» ae oy sy 5
A. kaa, kaa, kuu, kuu, pii, pii

The final stops /p, t, c, k, q/ may each be represented by a variety of sym-
pols. Any Labial stop symbol (nasals are continuants and not stops) occur~

Vv. VOWELS

You have already learned that the value (or pronunciation) of a vowel symbol
depends on the series to which the preceding consonant belongs. The following
chart shows the 1st and 2nd series values of the six vowel symbolizations (includ-
ing the lack of a vowel symbol, which indicates the inherent vowel) that you have
encountered so far.

Symbolization 1st Series Value 2nd Series Value

2 aa 20
2) aa ia
v mi
= ay ii
\ : u
- at at
ae ou uu
U
$- ei ee

The value of a vowel symbolization can be affected also by the final consonant sym-
bol, and by various diacritical marks. In fact, it is the total configuration of sym-
bols that determines the pronunciation of a syllable in the Cambodian writing sys-
tem. Fortunately, there is a finite number of such configurations, and with prac-
tice you will learn to recognize them easily. Furthermore, the pronunciation of
the configurations is, with few exceptions, regular and predictable. Cambodian

is much more regular in this respect than the English spelling system, where a
given spelling may represent several pronunciations, as in rough, bough, cough,
slough, etc. There is a certain amount of sound-to-symbol redundancy, however,
where a given sound may be represented in several different ways, parallel with
Vowels 103

the “so, sew, sow,” situation in English. In other words, it is easier to read
Cambodian correctly than to write it correctly. In this section, the value of a
vowel symbolization when final in the syllable is given first, followed by its
values as modified by final consonants and diacritics, if different.

You have learned that when a syllable is spelled with a single consonant,
or with an initial consonant symbol and an unmodified final consonant sym-

bol, it is pronounced with the inherent vowel; e.g. AS /kaa/, ASE
/saat/, #9 /90/, #885 /koot/, However, when the final symbol carries

a /bantag/ ( — ) or ‘shortener’, the syllable is pronounced with its “short
inherent” value, which in the 1st series is /a/, Transcribe and pronounce:

AS RA sy st Bs we 5885
A. kaat, kat, caap, cap, baan, ban, qah
When the initial consonant symbol belongs to the 2nd series, the short in-
herent vowel is /u/ before any Labial consonant symbol (#5 & 6 % £3).

121. You have now been introduced to all the configurations by which vowels are
represented in the Cambodian writing system. In the following chart, the
ist and 2nd series values of each vowel symbol, as well as each configura-
tion by which vowels are represented, are shown in the sequence in which
they occur in the standard Cambodian dictionary. Each vowel symbol is
followed by its name. Notice that the name of a symbol or configuration
may be different from its actual value in either series.

 

a. Practice reciting the names of the vowel symbols until you can recite
them in the proper sequence without referring to the chart.

b. Cover the 1st and 2nd series values of the symbols and reproduce the
1st series values by reference only to the symbols.

c. Cover the 2nd series values of the symbols and reproduce them by
reference only to the symbols.

122. If you have successfully mastered the preceding 121 exercises, you are now

prepared to read any regular single-initial monosyllabic word in the Cam-

bodian language. The following list includes every configuration by which
vowels are regularly represented in the Cambodian writing system. Most

of the examples in the list are actual words in the language, and are followed
by their definitions as a matter of interest. They are listed in the order in
which they would occur in the standard Cambodian dictionary. Each example

is followed by the number of the exercise in which that particular vowel

representation was presented. Transcribe and pronounce each word. When

VI. THE INDEPENDENT VOWEL SYMBOLS
Besides the “dependent” vowel symbols already discussed that always ac-
company an initial consonant symbol, there are 14 independent vowel symbols
called /sraq pif tue/ ‘self-sufficient vowels’, which occur in initial position in
some words, and which include an initial consonant, usually /q-/. Since these
symbols occur in relatively few words, Cambodians themselves disagree on their
use and pronunciation. Some independent vowel symbols, however, occur in very
common words, such as ‘to give’, ‘father’, and ‘bamboo’, so it is necessary to
jJearn them for reading even simple materials. The short independent vowel sym-
pols must be followed by a final consonant symbol; the long vowel symbols may
stand alone.
123. The symbol & is called /sraq aeq pifi tus/, ‘the independent vowel /qeq/’.
In most words a is equivalent to #¥ , although in some words it may be
> \
pronounced #§ or ¢¥ . Transcribe and pronounce the following syl-

words, in which it has the same valueas J . Transcribe and pronounce:

Vil. SOME DISYLLABLES

Disyllables in Cambodian typically consist of an unstressed presyllable
followed by a stressed main syllable. In the disyllables in this section, the
vowel of each successive syllable is determined by the series of its initial
consonant symbol, as in the monosyllables you have met. If the syllable

Q

& (in unstressed position) is pronounced /ni-/, and the syllable 5g78

Q

is pronounced /tion/, then &fE9R is pronounced /nitien/, Transcribe
and pronounce the following disyllables: 47.57 655 to speak, AD AS?

NV
language, PAVAS chair, SASpaER? book

A. niyiey, phiesaa, kawqoy, siewphiw

Although some presyllables are written with long vowel symbols, they are
usually reduced to short vowels in normal speech. Transcribe and pro-
nounce the following disyllables with short presyllable vowels:

\ 2
Ae kilo, ee! coffee, Ode clever, eae age

A, kilou, kafei, pukae, qayuq

When a presyllable is represented by a single consonant symbol (frequently

a reduplication of the initial consonant of the main syllable) it is pronounced

with the unwritten vowel /a/ after a 1st series consonant and /o/ after a 2nd

series consonant. These vowels are reduced to /o/ in rapid speech. Tran-

scribe and pronounce the following words: PAY EF to scratch, ARK

N fl
Independent Vowel Symbols 121

d V
SESAS thing, sass smooth, BR as to receive

A. kakaay, coceek, babuel, monuh, robah, roliiy, totuol

143. Presyllables containing two initial consonant symbols consist of the clus-
ters /pr-, tr-, cr-, kr-, or sr-/, with /pr-/ the most common. In such

clusters, -r- is written in its subscript form (é , and the syllable (as

in 142 above) is pronounced with the vowel /a/ after a 1st series Eye c;
or k/ and with the vowel /o/ after a 2nd series /p, t, c, or k/, both being
reduced to /a/ in rapid speech; s- in such presyllables is always 1st series.

(£9 with a subscript always has the value /p/.) Transcribe and pronounce;

Bm s to reserve, Goats dawn, Gas to meet, Bovey to re-

verse, Gs a perch, Ger confused, Gijie twisted, Adapen

to like

A. prakan, prolim, pratesh, tralap, tronum, cralam, krawioc, sralah

VIII. SUBSCRIPT CONSONANT SYMBOLS

When two consonants are pronounced consecutively within a word (without an
intervening vowel), the second (and sometimes, in medial position, a third) con-
sonant symbol is written in a special subscript form below the first symbol. The
subscript always follows the superscript in pronunciation. The form of the sub-
script is in most cases a smaller version of its superscript counterpart, but

without the /saq/ ‘hair’ which adorns the top of seven consonant symbols

(not to be confused with << /traysap/ which converts 1st series symbols to

2nd series). Some subscripts, however, bear no discernible relationship to their
counterparts. Subscript consonants are called /caen gaqsaa/ ‘consonant feet’,
and the resulting consonant clusters are called /qaqsaa damruaet/ ‘stacked-up
letters’.

144. The subscripts Q © ON ™ and $¥ are identical in form with
a 8s mM Hw a

their superscript counterparts. Subscripts are called ‘/coon__/”; e.g.,

5 is called /coan khaa/ ‘subscript /khaa/. Write each of the above con-

sonants with its subscript, and transcribe and pronounce the name of the
subscript.

IX. INITIAL CLUSTERS

152. With a very few exceptions, all occurrences of written initial clusters

(initial consonant symbol plus subscript) represent two-place initial se-
quences /CC-/ phonologically. When one of the aspirated consonant sym-

pols( 9 kh, & ch, § th, & ph, etc.) occurs in conjunction with a
subscript, it represents an unaspirated stop /k, c, t, or p/ phonologically.

For example, in #8  /thae/ ‘to care for’, represents /th-/, but in
8 /tlay/ ‘expensive’, it represents /t-/. In other words, there is
never an initial contrast between /CC-/ and /ChC-/ in Cambodian. For
example, the pronunciations of the initial sequences in re /kmein/
‘child’ and Pos /kmae/ ‘Cambodian’ are identical, although the first
is spelled with Af and the second with 9 . Transcribe and pronounce

/
the following: pros head, 977 as, & together, 1557 space, an AS

9,
clear, $@ dog, $367 tocomplain, arrow, Prey strange,
a Ro = i

. g
eR fruit, (Remember that £7 with a subscript is pronounced /p-/.

The vowels of the last two examples have their 1st series values.)

A. kbaal, kbaal, knia, klie, cbah, ckae, tqouf, tnuu, plaek, plae
Initial Clusters 125

153.

154.

155.

156.

157.

When an aspirated consonant symbol occurs as a subscript in a written
initial cluster, the cluster represents a three-place initial consonant se-
quence /CCC-/. Only three such sequences occur in initial position:
\ iN >
anes ( - Sess = /nii/) station, ies twenty, $997 drama.
a

Transcribe and pronounce the above three words ( #578 is pronounced
with a 1st series vowel). 2

A. sthaanii, mphiy, lkhaon

The subscript a is always pronounced /-d-/ in initial clusters. Tran-
/

seribe and pronounce: £7 husband, no hot, A227 to listen,

Y
Mi oe to originate.

A, pday, kdaw, sdap, pdaom

You have already learned that the value of a vowel symbol is determined
by the series of the preceding consonant (Exercise 2). However, in words
written with an initial cluster of consonant symbols, the governance of the
vowel is more complex. If both the initial consonant symbol and its sub-
script belong to the same series, there is no problem. In the following
words, both consonant and subscript are Ist series, so the vowel has its

1st series value: ane to weave, Pose tomorrow, 295 dif-
a oF &
ferent, ANF board, gm flower, ASF sugar, oe to inform,
o a a a
ig dog. Transcribe and pronounce these words.
A. tbaah, sqaek, psein, kdaa, pkaa, skaa, pdey, ckae

In the following words, both the initial consonant symbol and its subscript

When the initial consonant symbol and its subscript belong to different
series, any symbol representing a stop or spirant takes precedence over
any continuant in determining the series of a following vowel symbol. In
other words, symbols representing the consonants of Group 1 below domi-
nate symbols representing consonants of Group 2.

X. GOVERNANCE OF VOWEL SERIES IN WORDS
OF MORE THAN ONE SYLLABLE

In words of more than one syllable, as in monosyllables, the vowel series
in any syllable is governed by the last preceding dominant consonant sym-
bol. In the following words, the dominant initial consonant of the 1st syl-
lable takes precedence over the passive initial consonant of the 2nd syllable.
V 1
Transcribe and pronounce: Ne cigarette, (seme to hurry,
a J
(bres criss-crossed, (25297) approximately, Ben 89) to like,
(Barter ant.
A. baaray, prahap, crawat, pramaan, sralah, sramaoc
In the following words, the initial dominant consonant symbol belongs to the

2nd series, and both syllables have 2nd series vowel pronunciations. The
problem of governance does not arise here, however, since both syllables
Governance of Vowel Series 129

166,

have 2nd series initials. Transcribe and pronounce: G@& a perch,

oN NX y /
ASF thought, (dasts dawn, por coolie, ars to shoulder.

A. tronum, kumnit, prolim, kuulii, pronéaq

In a few words, however, a 2nd syllable initial continuant does not yield to
a lst series dominant initial in the first syllable (especially in some disyl-

lables with an initial ®f ), and the second syllable maintains its 2nd series
x y
value, as in: (Bs hammock, FITS category, sgh stroke,
Q o
BP g history (second syllable pronounced /-w6et/). Transcribe and

pronounce them. (The first syllable of the first example above is pronounced
/qan-/, and of the second and third examples, /qan-/.)

A. qgayjrin, qanloe, qanluuy, prawdet

In disyllables each of whose syllables begins with a dominant consonant,

the vowel series of each syllable is determined independently, consistent
with the rule stated in Exercise 161 above. In the following words each syl-
lable begins with a dominant 1st series consonant. Transcribe and pro-
nounce: PASAY 45 to scratch, Boe to compare, (Broas to an-

nounce, Gras lineage.

A. kakaay, pradouc, prakaah, trakoul

In the following words, the 1st syllable begins with a dominant 1st series
consonant and the second with a dominant 2nd series consonant. Transcribe

t
and pronounce: @reas country, @Bse to meet, @iow cool,
\ °
ef a to illumine, @& ® dark.
nv

A. prateeh, pratéoh, tracéoq, bamplii, sratum

In some disyllables an initial 2% in the second syllable is passive rather
than dominant, as in BES size, MEME soldier, SMF temple.
These words are sometimes written with a converted & 3 6-8,

~
2/8 , thus conforming to the rule stated in Exercise 164 above.
Transcribe and pronounce them.

XI. MEDIAL CLUSTERS
The commonest type of disyllables in Cambodian are disyllables whose ini-
tial syllable has the shape /CVN-/ (Consonant-Vowel-Nasal). In such words
the final nasal of the first syllable is written on the line and the initial con-
°
sonant of the 2nd syllable is written as its subscript; e.g., meh /kamlay/,

‘strength’. The initial syllable in such words has no written vowel, but is

/
pronounced as if there were a /bantaq/ ( — ) over the nasal, i.e. /a/ after
a Ast series initial, and after a second series initial, /u/ before & and

/i2/ before other nasal symbols (see Exercises 64-67). All these presyl-
lable vowels tend to be reduced to /a/ in rapid speech. As with initial clus-
ters, elements of the vowel symbol of the main syllable may be written be-
fore, above, below, and following the entire cluster; e.g., 277. HB

/bankaat/ ‘to originate’. The series of the 2nd syllable vowel is determined
by the rule described in Exercise 161. Transcribe and pronounce:

2 / /
Pies place, APH to press, sig pattle, A7(i574F for,

» °
£57088 to originate, mf # window, 2929 to force, 3S eye

ty

/
aS its society (final syllable pronounced #49).

A. kanlaey, sankat, cambay, samrap, baykaet, banquec, baykham, bafichoo,
bantiey, saykhim, bantup, saykum

The following words involve all three of the vowel alternants /a/u/t/ that
occur in initial syllables of shape /CVN-/. Transcribe and pronounce:

2 \
eee strip, Rae quarrel, 2938 vegetable, 78 & alisht,

ie

A. camrieq, cumlish, banlae, piionlii, kahcap, ctieficuun, banrien, puenriik
You learned in Exercise 154 that a /caan taa/ is always pronounced /-d-/

in initial clusters. Medially, however, its pronunciation is unpredictable.

As a general rule, when it occurs subscript to 6v? it is pronounced -d-,
a

and when subscript to a , it is pronounced /-t-/, Following this rule,

A. damruet, damrow, dambaah, damlay

Disyllables whose 1st syllable has the shape /| ‘Cvm-/ may be written either
with a medial cluster (/qgaqsaa damrust/ ‘stacked letters’) or with the

/niqkehet/ ( i ), commonly called /sraq qam/, For example, /kamlay/
‘strength’ may be spelled either in the /qaqsaa damruet/ form awh z

or in the /qaqsaa riey/ ‘consecutive letters’ form s ans (or s. ay 5 ;
since fF dominates ms , although fof in such syllables is more com-

mon). The result is that there is disagreement among Cambodians them-
selves about how such words are spelled. The trend, however, seems to be
toward preference of the more efficient /sraq qam/ spelling at the expense
of the conjunct spelling. In the official Cambodian dictionary the /sraq qam/
spelling is usually recommended where two spellings are possible, with two

exceptions: in words spelled with initial $$ — , and in roughly half the
entries spelled with initial A-— , the conjunct spelling is recommended.

Write the following words two ways: /damriet/ stacked, /kamsat/ destitute,
/samlaa/ stew, /tumyiion/ weight, /kamptioh/ height, /damloun/ (initial Y )
potatoes, /samlafi/ to like.

Programmed Reading Exercises
Medial clusters in which the subscript is a repetition of the preceding con-

sonant (geminate clusters) usually represent doubled consonants phonologi-
cally. The initial syllable of such words, if it has no written vowel, is usual-

t
ly pronounced as if it were written —Q- ,i-e. /a/ in the 1st series and
/éa/ or /62/ in the 2nd series (see Exercises 72-74). Transcribe and pro-

nounce: eee) girl, AY Coal sign, oe promise, ue article,

etl,

oO
£5 nsess library ( 97 = 29).

A. kaffiaa, safiaa, saccaa, woetthoq, pannaalay

When the syllable-final value of a consonant symbol differs from its syl-
lable-initial value, a geminate cluster represents two different but closely
related consonants phonologically. Transcribe and pronounce:

1 LN
BSI 455 (1st syllable pronounced AM £9 ) happy, £5 me (see Exer-
ee

cise 63) bamboo, BUT (ist syllable pronounced #) £9 ) proper.

A. sapbaay, rihsey, koapbay

A few words have medial clusters with two subscripts, resulting in three
consonant symbols written vertically. Almost all three-symbol clusters
consist of a nasal final in the first syllable, followed by a syllable whose
initial consonant is a stop of the same articulatory position (homorganic)
as the nasal, plus /-r-/, Transcribe and pronounce the following:

a xX
mig scissors, ag music, WP orks fox, FS(p7tF war.

A. kantray, dantrey, kancrooy, saykriom

Exceptions to this pattern occur in the following three loanwords:

wr Bas English, 5S (69% Sanskrit (1st syllable usually pronounced
en AM Gpmy professor (the second -S—- represents /-hs-/,

so that the cluster actually represents the sequence /-hstr-/ phonologically;

nounce them.

A. qankleeh ( ~ qanglee), sanskret, sahstraacaa

As in initial position, medial clusters which have an aspirated consonant as
subscript represent the sequence /-CCh-/. Transcribe and pronounce:

A. mit, put, monuh, pieg, bon, cat, sambot, somot, qaatit, root
When a word that is spelled with a silent final subscript occurs in the first

element of a compound, the subscript is pronounced as the initial of the fol-
lowing, usually unstressed, syllable. Transcribe and pronounce the follow-

Q

government.

A. mittephiep, puttasahsnaa, rdetthaaphibaal

In spelling words aloud, Cambodians pronounce consonant symbols with
their inherent vowels, regardless of the series of a following vowel. Vowel
symbols are referred to by their 1st series values, regardless of their pro-
nunciation in the word being spelled. Subscript consonants are cited after
superscript consonants, even in the case of /coey roo/, which precedes.

yY
For example, the word arse is spelled /baa, y99, cean kaa, sraq qae,
taa/. Transcribe and pronounce the syllables used in spelling the following

When the /réehmuk/ occurs alone after a consonant, it is called /sraq qah/.
However, when it follows a vowel symbol, it is called /réehmuk/ and follows
the name of the vowel symbol. Diacritics are usually named following the
consonant to which they apply, except that the /kbioh kraom/ is named fol-
lowing both the initial consonant symbol and vowel to which it applies. Tran-

Some words whose final syllables are spelled with a sequence of consonant
symbols, which would normally indicate the long inherent vowel, are pro-
nounced with the short inherent vowel, even though the final consonant does
not carry the /bantag/. Transcribe and pronounce the following words of

consonant symbols with no written vowel are pronounced as separate syl-
lables with the vowel /a/ after a Ist series symbol and /€a/ after a 2nd
series symbol when stressed, both reduced to /2/ when unstressed. Ina
formal or reading pronunciation such syllables are pronounced with an un-

written final /-a/, For example, $9307 ‘dawn’, is pronounced /garun/

in normal speech, reduced to /qerun/ in rapid speech; in very formal speech
it would be pronounced /qagrun/. In the following examples, heavily stressed

In some words whose second consonant symbol serves as the final of the
first syllable, the first syllable is pronounced /a/ in the 1st series and /éo/
or /6a/ in the 2nd series (see Exercises 72-74). Transcribe and pronounce

the following: ae letters, wG? enemy ( #$ represents the

words represents a double consonant /-cc-/, Transcribe and pronounce:
TEST handicratt, Prange cictionary ( —Ge - @x ).

A, raccenaa, waccenaanukram

In polysyllabic words, when the consonant symbols £7 or £§ occur ini-

tially and before § , they are pronounced with their normal inherent

Q
The short vowels — and -— , when no final consonant is written, are
always pronounced with a final /-q/ in final syllables. (One exception is
the unwritten final /-k/ of 8 /tok/‘table’.) Medially such vowels are

followed by /-q/ in a careful reading pronunciation, but the /-q/ disappears
in a more colloquial pronunciation. Transcribe each of the following exam-
ples first in a careful pronunciation and then in a more colloquial pronuncia-

tion. Brom mercy (second syllable irregularly pronounced with 2nd
series value), $3557 conduct (second syllable is irregularly pronounced
in the 2nd series, third syllable reverts to 1st series), one precept,

on? ony age (first syllable is /qa-/ in normal speech), Fine Sihanouk

(first syllable irregularly pronounced with 2nd series vowel).

XV. SOME IRREGULAR SPELLINGS

The rule that the pronunciation of a vowel symbol is determined by the last
preceding dominant consonant symbol in the same word (see Exercises 157
and 161) is without exception in monosyllables, is fairly regular in disyl-
lables (see Exercises 163 and 166 for exceptions), but is less regular in
polysyllabic words. Of the following three-syllable words, the first three
are regular throughout (with regard to governance of vowel series); the
fourth is irregular in the final syllable. Transcribe and pronounce them.

$839 8? to like, $788? miserable, AND era, heme
independence.

A. caettenaa, weettenie, saqkeraac, qaekkeriac

the rule that sonorant symbols are always passive. Transcribe and pronounce

XVII. NUMERALS

Cambodian numeral symbols were borrowed from the same Indic source as
the Cambodian alphabet; as with Arabic numerals, there are only ten dif-
ferent symbols. The names of Cambodian numerals, however, come from
various sources. The ten symbols are listed below with their Cambodian
names. Notice that the names of the symbols 6-9 are based on a system of
five. The final syllable of ‘seven’ is pronounced /-pii/ only in a reading
pronunciation; otherwise it is /-pil/, Transcribe and pronounce them.

225. In Cambodian numerals involving four or more symbols, a period is placed
after every three symbols, counting from the right (as in French). This
system of punctuation has little relevance to the pronunciation of Cambodian
numerals, however, since each succeeding numeral is read as a separate
denomination, rather than in groups of three. Transcribe the names of the
following numerals, separating each denomination larger than 100 by a com-
ma in the transcription.

Both the Buddhist Era and the Christian Era are used in Cambodian, al-
though the latter is more common in secular life. The Buddhist Era date
is obtained by adding 543 years to the Christian Era date; e.g. A.D. 1968+

543 = B.E. 2511. The word for Buddhist Era is prime

fe
/puttosagkeraac/ and is abbreviated $7.59, . The word for Christian Era
is @avassn Q/rihsagkoraac/ and is abbreviated #9. AJ, . When a

date is written in its full form, the day of the week precedes, followed by
the day of the month, the month, and the year. Transcribe and pronounce

APPENDIX B

Transliteration System for Khmer Script

This system of transliteration is a modification of that
proposed by Lewitz (1969), and was developed by Franklin Huffman
of Cornell University and Edwin Bonsack of the U.S. Library of
Congress for the use of librarians in cataloguing publications in
Khmer. A transliteration system, unlike the transcription system
outlined in Appendix A, is not based on pronunciation, but is
rather a one-to-one conversion of the symbols of one writing
system to those of another writing system. The great disadvantage
of this system is that, being based on the original values of the
Indic characters in which Khmer was first written, it obscures the
pronunciation of modern Khmer; its advantages are its relative
simplicity and the fact that it makes possible the etymological
reconstruction - although not the current usage - of Pali and
Sanskrit loanwords in Khmer.

686 Appendix B

Notes

1. In the consonant colums, x shows the position of the super-
script relative to the subscript. A subscript is always roman
ized after the superscript, without an intervening vowel, as in
pret krakhvdk.

2. When sj ocours as a superscript, the lower element is omitted,
as in m Aj. When m occurs as its own subscript, it takes the
full form x, as in mmo kafifia. Otherwise, the subscript has the
form of the lower element alone, as in @ khi.

3. The consonant v , followed by the vowel 1, takes the form § .
4, In the vowel columns, x shows the position of the consonant
relative to the vowel. This applies both to the Khmer and to the
romanization columns. It should be noted that an x in the Khmer
column can also represent a final consonant with no vowel follow-
ing, in which case it is romanized simply as x, as in o dab.

5. The consonants x m and x? kb are always preceded by a vowel,
put, being finals, never themselves bear a vowel. They may,
however, be preceded by vowels other than a, as in A pum, we seb.
6. The diacritics ¥ and ¥ are romanized by x’and x/ immediately
following the consonant they modify. They have the alternative
form x when they co-occur with one of the superscript vowels x,
%, x, and %. When x co-occurs with one of the superscript vowels
and with one of the consonants h, %, 8, , %, BOE Us ab 2s!
romanized as x4 as in § p’i. When x co-occurs with one of the
superseript vowels and with one of the consonants w, u, or #, 10
is romanized as x4 as in § s’I. Otherwise x represents the vowel
u, as in ya mun.

2. The diacritics x, x, x$ and x° in the romanization column are
placed after the last letter of the word in which they occur, a8
in nga Ksatriy 5 wie ca? , g taf, mag gatman’ .

8. Conventional signs are:

, romanized by repeating the preceding word or phrase
400% romanized as .1.
IU romanized as .p.

- romanized by means of the hyphen (-)
a romanized by means of the colon (:)
4, w romanized by means of the period ie
The full-stop signs © and @4#- are omitted in romanization.
Appendix B 687

9. In Khmer, words are not written separately; spacing occurs
only after longer phrases. In romanization, however, the short-
est written form which can stand alone as a word is treated as
such. This applies also to Pali and Sanskrit loanwords. Other
loanwords have the same divisions as in the original language.
10. Two adjustments must be made in the above system for type-
written Khmer: 1) The symbol § should be transliterated © rather
than au, as in jw oy. 2) The symbol % does double duty for both
£ and 2, in the two particles % and § , it should be transliter-
ated ka‘ and ja‘; in all other occurrences it should be trans-
literated %, as in ;usune8 prayojan’.
