# Numerals and Abbreviation

## A. Numerals

Cambodian numeral symbols were borrowed from the same Indic source as the alphabet. Although Arabic numerals are well known, especially in urban areas, as a result of French influence, the Indic symbols (identical with those used in Thai) are used almost exclusively in Cambodian publications.

Aithough the symbols themselves are based on the decimal system, the names underlying them reveal an older system based on five, as can be seen in the names of the numerals 6-9, which are 5+1, 5+2, 5+3, and 5+4 respectively. The names of the numerals 1-9 and zero are as follows:

## B. Notes of the Numerals

### 1.

In Cambodian numerals involving four or more symbols, a period is placed after every three symbols, counting from the right to the left (as in French). This system of punctuation has little relevance to the pronunciation of Cambodian numerals, however, since each succeeding numeral is read as a separate denomination, rather than in groups of three. Such additive components, except in numbers smaller than 100, are typically separated by rising intonation (represented by a comma in the transcription). This rising intonation never occurs in compounds separated by close juncture (represented by a hyphen in the transcription),

> ...
> /.../
> 2,000,000 + 300,000 + 50,000 + 4,000 + 700 + 55 (= 2,354,755)

No punctuation is used, however, in writing dates; e.g., 62--9604 1914--1918.

## C. Abbreviations

The use of abbreviations is not as common in Cambodian as in western languages; e.g., there are no established abbreviations for the names of months. Dictionaries and other technical works tend to coin abbreviations as needed; the official _Cambodian Dictionary_ contains a long list of abbreviations for use in giving information about lexical entries, many of which are found in other dictionaries, and many of which were invented _ad hoc_. In addition, the following abbreviations are relatively standardized.

### 1. Dates

In Cambodian dates the Christian era is generally used for most publications. However, the traditional Buddhist era is used in older publications and in religious texts, and in many publications both are used concurrently. The Buddhist era is reckoned from the year of the death of the Buddha, usually considered to be the year 543 B.C, Thus, when confronted with a Buddhist era date, subtract 543 years to obtain the Christian era equivalent, e.g., B.E. 2510-543 = A.D, 1967. The two eras are abbreviated as follows:

> ... = ... /.../ Buddhist era

> ... = ... /.../ Christian era


When a date is written in its full form, the day of the week precedes, followed by the day of the month, the month, and the year, as in the following example:

> ... ... ... ... ... ... 
> /.../
> Wednesday, the twenty-fourth of January, 1968.

Dates may be numerically abbreviated, however, in which case only the day, month, and year are indicated by numerals only, separated by a hyphen. The above date, in its shortest form, would be:

> ...

### 2. Currency

The Cambodian monetary unit is the រៀល /riəl/, which is divided into 100 ... /sein/ ‘cents’. In accounting, រៀល is abbreviated រ, which is written between the riels and the cents as follows:

> ៤៥រ០០ /saesəp-pram riəl/ forty-five riels.

In columns of figures, the រ may be written only in the top figure and is replaced in succeeding figures by a period or a comma.

> ៤៥រ០០ 45 riels
> ៣៥,០០ 35 riels

Sometimes both a comma and a superscript រ are written:

> ... riels

Sometimes the រ occurs after the cents figure:

> ៤៥,០០រ 45 riels

## D. Pagination

The great majority of Cambodian publications use Cambodian numerals for numbering pages in the main body of a book, usually at the top center and set off by dashes: -...-, -...-, -...-, -....-, etc. Arabic numerals are very rarely used for pagination, except in some bilingual publications. For the pagination of material preliminary to the main body of a book, and for listing major headings within a chapter, the consonants of the alphabet are used in their dictionary order, e.g. ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., etc. These may in turn be followed by subheadings listed by numerals, in the following pattern:
