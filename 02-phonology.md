# Phonology

In order to talk about the relationship between sound and symbol, one must have an accurate description of the sound system of the language. The system of transcription used herein was devised for use in the author’s _Modern Spoken Cambodian_ textbook, and represents the segmental phonemes of standard Cambodian, which is taught in the schools and spoken by educated Cambodians. Although some colloquial dialects, notably that of Phnom Penh and the immediately surrounding area, differ considerably from the standard at the phonological level, standard Cambodian is virtually identical with the dialect spoken by the majority of the people in the central provinces, and is understood throughout the country. If this book is used concurrently with _Modern Spoken Cambodian_, neither the sound system of the language nor the transcription used here will present a problem to the student. For the sutdent who has no prior acquaintance with the sound system, an attempt is made below at a phonetic description of the sounds represented by the transeription. Such descriptions, however, are at best approximate, and it is recommended that the student have the examples listed in this section pronounced by a native speaker if at all possible.

## A. Consonants

The consonant phonemes of Cambodian are arranged in an articulatory chart below. The terminology used in the chart is useful in later chapters in dealing with the relationships between the writing system and certain groups of articulatorily related consonants. It is also relevant to the arrangement of consonant symbols in the Cambodian alphabet. Those symbols preceded by a hyphen occur both initially and finally.

## B. Initial Consonant Sequences

Eighty-five two-place initial consonant sequences /CC-/and two three-sequences /CCC-/ occur in Cambodian words. Their distribution is shown below.

... 

when the stops /p t c k/ occur as the first member of two-place initial consonant sequences /CC-/, they are unaspirated before /r s h/, slightly aspirated before voiceless stops and all continuants other than /x/ (except in the homorganic sequence /im-/), and released with slight vocalisim pefore /q b d/ and in the sequence /...-/. When the consonants /q m l/ occur as the first consonant of /CC-/ sequences, they are released with slight vocalism.

## C. Vowels

There are thirty-one different vowels and vowel combinations which occur as vocalie nuclei of Cambodian syllables. These nuclei are here analyzed as consisting of only thirteen vowel phonemes: ten short vowels and three short diphthongs. In Chart 3 the arrows represent sequences of vowel phonemes (long diphthongs). Tong vowels and long diphthongs, which are equivalent in length, are treated as sequences of two short vowels. The long vowels /.../ and /.../ have no short counterparts. The short diphthongs, which are equivalent in length to short vowels, have no long counterparts, and so must be treated as unit phonemes, They are written with a breve to distinguish them from long diphthongs. The following nuclei occur:

- 10 long vowels: //
- 10 long diphtongs: //
- 8 short vowels: //
- 3 short diphtongs: //

Altogether 31 vowel nuclei.

## E. Marginal Phonemes and Phoneme Combinations

Certain marginal phonemes and combinations are introduced by French loanwords which are not completely assimilated to the phonological structure of native Cambodian words.
