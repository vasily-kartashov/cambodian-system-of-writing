# Phonology

In order to talk about the relationship between sound and symbol, one must have an accurate description of the sound system of the language. The system of transcription used herein was devised for use in the author’s _Modern Spoken Cambodian_ textbook, and represents the segmental phonemes of standard Cambodian, which is taught in the schools and spoken by educated Cambodians. Although some colloquial dialects, notably that of Phnom Penh and the immediately surrounding area, differ considerably from the standard at the phonological level, standard Cambodian is virtually identical with the dialect spoken by the majority of the people in the central provinces, and is understood throughout the country. If this book is used concurrently with _Modern Spoken Cambodian_, neither the sound system of the language nor the transcription used here will present a problem to the student. For the sutdent who has no prior acquaintance with the sound system, an attempt is made below at a phonetic description of the sounds represented by the transeription. Such descriptions, however, are at best approximate, and it is recommended that the student have the examples listed in this section pronounced by a native speaker if at all possible.

## A. Consonants

The consonant phonemes of Cambodian are arranged in an articulatory chart below. The terminology used in the chart is useful in later chapters in dealing with the relationships between the writing system and certain groups of articulatorily related consonants. It is also relevant to the arrangement of consonant symbols in the Cambodian alphabet. Those symbols preceded by a hyphen occur both initially and finally.

### Phonetic Key

* /p/ Voiceless unaspirated bilablial stop. In initial position like the p in pin, but without the aspiration; or like the p in spin. In final position like the p in up.
* /t/ Voiceless unaspirated dental stop. Initially like the t in top, but without the aspiration; or like the t in stop. Finally like the t in hot.
* /c/ Voiceless unaspirated palatal stop. Initially like the ch in cheese, but without the aspiration. Finally it represents an unreleased closure made with the blade of the tongue against the front part of the hard palate.
* /k/ Voiceless unaspirated velar stop. Initially like the k in key, but without the aspiration; or like the k in ski. Finally like the ck in back. After the vowels /ii, ei, ee, or ae/ it is intermediate between /c/ and /k/; the two never contrast in that position.
* /q/ Voiceless unaspirated glottal stop. Initially like the closure which occurs at the beginning of the word Oh! when pronounced explosively. Finally like the closure which occurs at the end of the first Oh in the exclamation Oh, oh (he’s done it again!).
* /b/ Voiced unaspirated bilabial stop. Like the b in bin, but more tense.
* /d/ Voiced unaspirated dental stop. Like the d in day, but more tense.
* /f/ Voiceless labio-dental spirant. Like the f in fool. Occurs only in a few loanwords.
* /s/ Voiceless dental groove spirant. Like the s in sit.
* /h/ Voiceless glottal spirant. Initially like English h in hot. In final position its point of articulation is much fronter, somewhat like the German ch in Ich.
* /m/ Voiced bilabial nasal. Like the m in mom, ham.
* /n/ Voiced dental nasal. Like the n in no, on.
* /ñ/ Voiced palatal nasal. Like ny in canyon, but occurs initially and finally in Cambodian.
* /ŋ/ Voiced velar nasal. Like ng in sing, but occurs both initially and finally in Cambodian. After the vowels /ii, ei, ee, ae/ it is intermediate between /i/ and /n/; the two never contrast in that position.
* /w/ Voiced labio-dental semi-vowel. Spirantized in initial position, like the English v in voodoo, but with more lip-rounding. May be delabialized in final position.
* /y/ Voiced palatal semi-vowel. Like English y in you, but more tense.
* /l/ Voiced lateral. Like English l in late, ale.
* /r/ Voiced retroflex. May be slightly trilled initially, but usually pronounced as a single flap, like the Spanish r in pero.

## B. Initial Consonant Sequences

Eighty-five two-place initial consonant sequences /CC-/and two three-sequences /CCC-/ occur in Cambodian words. Their distribution is shown below.

When the stops /p t c k/ occur as the first member of two-place initial consonant sequences /CC-/, they are unaspirated before /r s h/, slightly aspirated before voiceless stops and all continuants other than /x/ (except in the homorganic sequence /kŋ-/), and released with slight vocalisim pefore /q b d/ and in the sequence /kŋ-/. When the consonants /q m l/ occur as the first consonant of /CC-/ sequences, they are released with slight vocalism.

## C. Vowels

There are thirty-one different vowels and vowel combinations which occur as vocalie nuclei of Cambodian syllables. These nuclei are here analyzed as consisting of only thirteen vowel phonemes: ten short vowels and three short diphthongs. In Chart 3 the arrows represent sequences of vowel phonemes (long diphthongs). Tong vowels and long diphthongs, which are equivalent in length, are treated as sequences of two short vowels. The long vowels /ɛɛ/ and /ɔɔ/ have no short counterparts. The short diphthongs, which are equivalent in length to short vowels, have no long counterparts, and so must be treated as unit phonemes, They are written with a breve to distinguish them from long diphthongs. The following nuclei occur:

- 10 long vowels: /ii, ee, ɛɛ, ɨɨ, əə, aa, ɑɑ, uu, oo, ɔɔ/
- 10 long diphtongs: /iə, ɨə, uə, ei, əɨ, ou, ae, aə, ao, ɔə/
- 8 short vowels: /i, e, ɨ, ə, a, ɑ, u, o/
- 3 short diphtongs: /.../

Altogether 31 vowel nuclei.

### Phonetic Key

### Long Vowels and Diphtongs

* /ii/ as in /ciik/ ‘to dig’. High front unrounded vowel like English ee in cheek.
* /iə/ as in /biə/ ‘playing cards’. Falling diphthong, moving from a high front to a mid central position.

* /ei/ as in /kmeiŋ/ ‘to be young’. Tense diphthong starting at a point lower than, and ending at a point higher than, /ee/ above.
* /ɛɛ/ as in /lɛɛŋ/ ‘to quit’. Lower-mid front unrounded vowel with lax and breathy articulation; similar to French _ai_ in _aide_. Occurs long only.

* /e/ as in /seh/ ‘horse’. Mid front unrounded short vowel, like English _e_ in _set_.
* /ɨ/ as in /kɨt/ ‘to think’. High central unrounded short vowel; shorter and lower than /ɨɨ/ described above.

* /.../ as in /.../ ‘3rd person pronoun’. Sometimes falling, sometimes rising, short diphthong, moving from a position slightly lower than /o/ above to a mid central position.

## D. Word Structure

### 1. Monosyllables

The structure of monosyllables is shown by the formula C1(C2)(C3)V1(V2)(C4), with the limitation that if V2 doesn’t occur, then C4 must occur. In other words, short vowels are always followed by a consonant in stressed syllables. Thus monosyllables containing a short vowel or diphthong will have one of the following three shapes; the third is rare.

1) CV́C /bət/ ‘to close’, /kit/ ‘to think’
2) CCV́C /sdap/ ‘to hear’ /proh/ ‘male’
3) CCCV́C /sthət/ (~ /that/) ‘to be located’

Monosyllables containing a long vowel or diphthong occur in the following five shapes; the fifth is rare.

1) CV́V /kaa/ ‘work‘ /puu/ ‘uncle’
2) CV́VC /baan/ ‘to have’ /qaoy/ ‘to give’
3) CCV́V /chɨɨ/ ‘to be ill’ /psaa/ ‘market?
4) CCV́VC /craən/ ‘much’ /sqaat/ ‘to be clean’
5) CCCV́CC /sthaan/ (~ /thaan/) ‘place’ /lkhaon/ ‘drama‘

Sequences of three initial consonants occur only rarely, and then C3 is always /h/.

### 2. Disyllables

_Minor disyllables_ consist of an unstressed presyllable of shape CV+, CrV+, CVN+, or CrVN+, followed by a stressed syllable. Minor syllables occur with high frequency in Cambodian, and might almost equal the monosyllable in total inventory if not in frequency. In minor disyllables the vowel of the unstressed presyllable is usually reduced to /o/ in normal speech.

__Examples:__ 
* CV+Ś /kɑkáay ~ kəkáay/ ‘to scratch about’
* CrV+Ś /prɑkán ~ prəkán ~ pəkán/ ‘to object’
* CVN+Ś  /baŋkáət ~ bəŋkáət ~ pəkáət/ ‘to originate’
* CrVN+Ś /prambə́y ~ prəmbə́y ~ pəmbə́y/ ‘eight’

Major disyllables consist of two stressed syllables in close juncture. Most such words are compounds; some, however, are morphologically simple (as are the first two examples below).

__Examples:__

* /sìəwphɨ́w/ (~ /səphɨ́w/) ‘book’
* /phìəsáa/ ‘language’
* /bùəŋ-súəŋ/ ‘to pray’
* /sdúəc-sdáəŋ/ ‘insignificant’

### 3. Polysyllables

Polysyllables are rare in colloquial speech, and can usually be identified as loanwords from Pali, Sanskrit, or French sources. Words of up to six syllables occur in formal speech, and even longer words occur in written texts. Such polysyllables tend to conform in normal speech to the stress pattern typical of disyllables; i.e. alternation of an unstressed with a stressed syllable.

**Examples:**
 
* Three syllables: /.../ ‘usually’
* Four syllables: /pút+tə+sáh+snáa/ ‘Buddhism’
* Five syllables: /.../ ‘royal government’
* Six syllables:  /wi+cáa+rə+náq+kə+tháa/ ‘editorial’

## E. Marginal Phonemes and Phoneme Combinations

Certain marginal phonemes and combinations are introduced by French loanwords which are not completely assimilated to the phonological structure of native Cambodian words.

**Phonemes:**

* /š/ in /šaek/ check (Fr. cheque)
* /z/ in /qaazii/ Asia (Fr. Asie)
* /g/ in /qaŋglei/ English (Fr. anglais)

**Combinations:**

* /by/ and /eə/ in /byeə/ beer (Fr. biere)
