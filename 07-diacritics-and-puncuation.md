## B. Punctuation

Although the common western punctuation marks, such as . , ; : ! ? ..., etc. are being used in Cambodian writing with increased frequency, as a result of French influence, there are a number of punctuation signs which are characteristically Cambodian,

### 1. ... /.../ space

Cambodian words are not normally separated by spaces in closely knit syntactic phrases or single-clause sentences. The /.../ ‘space’ is used in a way roughly analogous to the use of the comma in English, but is more comprehensive. There are stylistic differences from one text to another, but space typically occurs in the following situations:

a) between clauses within a sentence
b) between sentences in a cohesive group of sentences
c) after preposed adverbial words or phrases, such as “usually,” “today,” “in that town,” etc.
d) before and after proper names
e) before and after numbers
f) before and after the symbols ..., ..., ..., and ... (explained below)
g) between coordinate words in lists
