# Unwritten Sounds

## A. Unwritten Vowels

In the Cambodian writing system certain vowels are indicated by the absence of a vowel symbol in specific environments. Although the following general rules are valid for the great majority of cases, there are some exceptions and ambiguities, especially in learned or unfamiliar vocabulary.

### 1. The Long Inherent Vowel (/ɑɑ/ɔɔ/)

...

### 2. The Short Inherent Vowel (/.../u/.../)

....

### 3. The Short Vowels /a/.../.../

...

## B. Unwritten Consonants

### 1. Internal Doubling

In many words of more than one syllable, a medial consonant symbol serves both as the final consonant of one syllable and the initial consonant of the next; phonologically the consonant is doubled, and the extra syllable, if no vowel is written, is pronounced with the short vowel /a/.../ (depending on the series) if stressed, and /.../ if unstressed. (See section A 3 b)

....

### 2. Unwritten /-q/ after Stressed Short Vowels

a) The unwritten vowels /a/.../, when stressed, are followed by a final /-q/, both medially and finally.

Medially: 

* ... /.../ inhuman (supernatural)
* ... /.../ fearless

Finally:

* ... /qaqkhoosaq/ voiceless
* ... /.../ interval

b) The short vowels ... add ... when no final consonant is written, are pronounced, when stressed, with a final /-q/. Medially this final /-q/ tends to occur after all such vowels in a careful or reading pronunciation, but disappears with loss of stress in a more colloquial pronunciation. It _always_ occurs finally.

Medially: 

* ... /kaqruqnaa ~ karunaa ~ .../ mercy
* ... /keqrigyaa ~ keriyaa/ conduct

Finally: 

* ... /latthig ~ .../ belief, precept
* អាយុ /qgaayug ~ qayuq/ age
* ... /siihanuq/ Sihanouk

c) There is one example of an unwritten final /-k/.

* តុ /tok/ table
