# The Vowel Symbols

## A. Names of the Vowel Symbols

Cambodian vowel symbols may consist of one or a combination of elements written before, above, below, or after the initial consonant symbol. The complex symbols should be learned as units, since their values may bear little relation to the values of their individual components. As was pointed out in Chapter III, B1, the pronunciation of a vowel symbol in Cambodian is determined by the series of the initial consonant that it accompanies. When referring to a given vowel symbol, Cambodians usually use the word ស្រៈ /sraq/ ‘vowel’ followed by the 1st series value of the symbol. These names are preceded phonologically by /q-/, since every syllable in Cambodian must begin with a consonant. In the chart that follows, the vowel symbols are listed in their dictionary order (in Cambodian dictionaries, words are ordered _primarily_ by initial consonant, _secondarily_ by vowel symbol). Each symbol is followed by its name, its 1st series value, and its 2nd series value.

## B. Values of Syllabic Configurations

The value of a given symbol may also depend on its environment; i.e. on the final consonant symbol that follows it in the same syllable, and on stress factors. Vowel sounds are also represented by the absence of a vowel symbol, by certain configurations of consonant symbols, and by various diacritics. It is thus clear that the Cambodian syllable must be read as a _configuration_. In the following chart, all the configurations by which vowels are regularly represented are listed in the order in which they occur in the official _Cambodian Dictionary_ of the Buddhist Institute (Bibliography Item 4), and each configuration is exemplified in both series.

## D. Redundancy

In the preceding sections, it can be seen that the notation of Cambodian vowel sounds is “regular” in the sense that, given sufficient information about the environment of a vowel symbol, its pronunciation can be predicted; in other words, except where the independent vowel symbols are involved, it is seldom necessary to say: “sometimes pronounced --, and sometimes pronounced --.” (There are some irregularities, however, which are dealt with in Chapter X.) The Cambodian writing system does depart from the principle of a one-to-one ratio between sound and symbol in that a given vowel sound can be represented in a variety of ways. The following chart takes the vowel sounds as the starting point and shows the various ways in which they may be represented in the writing system. The regular, or typical, spelling is given first, followed by less typical spellings.

The consonant symbol ... is used as a base for 1st series syllables, and ... is used for 2nd series syllables.
