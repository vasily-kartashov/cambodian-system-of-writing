# Subscript Consonant Symbols

## A. Subscript Forms

When two consonant symbols are pronounced consecutively (without an intervening vowel) within a word, the second (and sometimes, in medial position, a third) consonant symbol is written in a special subscript form below the first symbol. The form of the subscript is in most cases a smaller version of its superscript counterpart, but without the ... /saq/ ‘hair’ (not to be confused with the /treysap/(...); see Chap. II, A 2) which adorns the top of seven consonant symbols. Some subscripts, on the other hand, bear no discernible relationship to their counterparts, and must be learned in addition to the basic superscript forms. These subscripts are called ... /.../ ‘consonant feet’ in Cambodian, and the resulting consonantal groups are referred to as ... /.../ ‘combined consonants’

### 7. Final Clusters

Many loanwords are spelled with an etymological final cluster, the subscripts of which are not pronounced, since only one consonant may occur phonologically at the end of a Cambodian word. Following are some common words spelled with final clusters:

* ... /.../ friend
* ... /put/ Buddha
* ... /.../ state
* ... /.../ menu
* ... /.../ wife
* ... /.../ word
* ... /.../ doctor
* ... /kam/ karma
* ... /bon/ merit
* ... /.../ heart, mind
* ... /sat/ animal
* ... /.../ motor
* ... /sambot/ letter
* ... /samot/ ocean
* ... /.../ priest
* ... /.../ group, circle
* ... /.../ sun
* ... or ... /.../ province

If a final cluster has ... as superscript, they are both unpronounced, e.g.:

* ... /qaacaa/ teacher

However, when a word which is spelled with a final cluster occurs as the first element of a compound, the subscript is activated as the initial of a following syllable, e.g.:

* ... /.../ friendship 
* ... /.../ government
* ... /.../ Buddhism
* ... /.../ worker
