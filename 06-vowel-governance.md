# Vowel Governance

As shown in Chapter II, the pronunciation of a vowel symbol is determined, or “governed,” by the series to which the initial consonant symbol belongs. However, in words with more than one initial consonant symbol, and in words of more than one syllable, the governance of the vowel series is more complex.

## A. Monosyllables

1. If both superscript and subscript belong to the same series, there is no problem; e.g.:

- Both superscript and subscript are Series 1; vowel is Series 1:

* ក្បាល /kbaal/ head 
* ស្អែក /sqaek/ tomorrow
* ... /pseiŋ/ different

- Both superscript and subscript are Series 2; vowel is Series 2:

* ... /lmɔɔm/ sufficient 
* ... /pcum/ to assemble 
* ម្នាស់ /.../ pineapple

2. If, however, the two consonant symbols belong to different series, the following two rules apply:

1) Any _stop_ or _spirant_ takes precedence over any _continuant_ in determining the series of a following vowel. In other words, symbols representing the consonants of Group I below dominate symbols representing consonants of Group II:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=5>Group I - Dominant</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>p</td>
    <td>t</td>
    <td>c</td>
    <td>k</td>
    <td>q</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>b</td>
    <td>d</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>f</td>
    <td>s</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>h</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=4>Group II - Passive</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>m</td>
    <td>n</td>
    <td>ñ</td>
    <td>ŋ</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>w</td>
    <td>r</td>
    <td>l</td>
    <td>y</td>
  </tr>
</table>

a) In the following examples, the dominant consonant belongs to the 1st series, so the vowel has its 1st series value.

Superscript is dominant, subscript is passive:

* ត្រី /trəy/ fish
* ផ្នែក /pnaek/ section
* ស្វា /swaa/ monkey

Superscript is passive, subscript is dominant:

* ម្ហូប /mhoup/ food 
* ម្តាយ /mdaay/ mother 
* ល្អ​ /lqɑɑ/ pretty

b) In the following examples, the dominant consonant belongs to the 2nd series, so the vowel has its 2nd series value. 

Superscript is dominant, subscript is passive:

* ឃ្លាន /kliən/ be hungry
* ... /pnɛɛk/ eyes 
* ... /kniə/ together

Superscript is passive, subscript is dominant:

* ... /mteeh/ a pepper 
* ម្ជុល /mcul/ needle

Since both consonant symbols in these examples belong to the same series, there is no problem of governance; they are listed to provide contrast with the 1st series examples in a) above.

2) When both superscript and subscript are dominant, the series of the vowel is determined by the series of subscript. In the following examples, the superscript is 1st series while the subscript is 2nd series, so the vowel has its 2nd
series value.

* ផ្ទះ /.../ house
* ... /.../ to know
* ... /.../ to be high

In such words, only 1st series consonants occur as superscripts, since the series of the vowel is always determined by the subscript.

## B. Disyllables

Both of the foregoing can be summarized in a single unified rule, which is valid for all monosyllables, as well as for most disyllables, which contain prevocalic consonants of differing series.

__RULE__: In any syllable which is preceded in the same word by consonants of different series, the series of the vowel will be determined by the last preceding stop or spirant.

1. In the following examples involving disyllables, the dominant consonant of the first syllable takes precedence over the passive consonant of the second syllable.

a) C<sub>1</sub> is 1st series, so the vowel of both syllables is 1st series:

* ... /prɑyat/ to be careful 
* ... /barəy/ cigarette
* ... /crɑwat/ criss-crossed
* ... /srɑlañ/ to like
* ... /kɑnlaeŋ/ place 
* ... /kɑmnaət/ birth

b) C<sub>1</sub> is 2nd series, so the vowel of both syllables is 2nd series:

* ... /prɔlɨm/ dawn 
* ... /trɔnum/ a perch
* ... /kumnɨt/ thought 
* ... /.../ weight

In such words as these, of course, the problem of governance doesn’t arise, since the initials of both syllables are 2nd series, with the consequence that the vowels of both syllables are 2nd series. However, these examples do illustrate the principle of “vowel harmony” which operates in disyllables whose second syllable has an initial continuant.

2. In disyllables each of whose syllables begins with a stop or spirant, the vowel series of each syllable is determined independently, consistent with the rule stated above. The great majority of such words have a 1st series vowel in the presyllable, regardless of the series of the 2nd syllable vowel.

a) 1st series vowel in both syllables:

* ... /kɑkaay/ to scratch about 
* ... /kaafei/ coffee
* ... /prɑcam/ assigned to 
* ... /bɑŋkaət/ to originate

b) 1st series vowel in first syllable, 2nd series vowel in second syllable:

* ... /prɑteeh/ country
* ... /.../ cool
* ... /sɑntuuc/ fish hook
* ... /bɑmplɨɨ/ to illumine

In a few words having a 2nd series stop or spirant in the second syllable, vowel harmony is maintained by requiring a 2nd series initial consonant in the first syllable.

* ... /.../ to flap about
* ... /cɔcɛɛk/ to discuss
* ... /trɔtuuŋ/ distance from toes to fingertips

In a few non-harmonic disyllables, however, the typical order is reversed, with a 2nd series vowel in the first syllable and a first series vowel in the second syllable.

* ... /rɔbɑh/ thing 
* ... /.../ stairs

### 3. Exceptions to the Rule

In some disyllables with an initial ... in the second syllable, a 2nd series consonant in the first syllable imposes its series on the second syllable; i.e. ... functions as a passive consonant.

* ... /tumhim/ size
* ... /wihiə/ temple
* ... /tiəhiən/ soldier

These words are sometimes written with a converted ...; e.g., ..., thus conforming to the rule. In monosyllables, however, ... is always dominant, e.g., ល្ហុង /lhoŋ/ ‘papaya‘.

Conversely, in some disyllables (especially in some disyllables with initial ...), a normally dominant initial consonant in the first syllable fails to impose its series on a following passive consonant:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=3>Irregular</th>
    <th colspan=3>Regular</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>history</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>/crawat/</td>
    <td>criss-crossed</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>hammock</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>/qamroh/</td>
    <td>profession</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>category</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>to beg</td>
  </td>
</table>

## C. Polysyllables

In longer words, the rule applies much less consistently. The following two examples are regular with regard to the rule.

1) ... /caettənaa/ to like
2) ... /weettəniə/ miserable

In the first example, the syllable ... is pronounced /-naa/ because of a preceding ist series ...; in the second example, —... is pronounced /.../ because of a preceding 2nd series .... In the following two examples, however, the first is regular, the second irregular:

1) ... /saqkəraac/ century
2) ឯករាជ /qaekkəriəc/ independence (rather than the expected */qaekkəraac/).
