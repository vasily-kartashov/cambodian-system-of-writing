# Irregular Spellings

In the preceding sections we have been dealing primarily with the “regular” aspects of the Cambodian writing system, in the sense that the pronunciation of any symbol or sequence of symbols could be unambiguously predicted, given sufficient information about the environment of the symbol, or about the composition of a constellation of symbols. The purpose of this section is not to provide an exhaustive list of irregularities, such as those found in only one or two words, put rather to point up irregular spellings which occur in enough words to constitute “sub-systems” of the writing system. The first three irregularities below have already been encountered in the preceding chapters, but are included here to provide an inventory of the major sub-systems.

## 1. /ɑ/../ instead of /ɑɑ/ɔɔ/

Some syllables spelled with a sequence of two consonant symbols are pronounced with a short vowel /.../ or /.../, rather than with the expected long /.../ or /.../ (see Chapter IX, A 1 a).

* ... /sɑm/ proper (cf. សម /sɑɑm/ fork)
* ... /.../ car (cf. រក /rɔɔk/ search for)

## 2. /ɑ/../ instead of /a/../../

Some syllables spelled with a sequence of two consonants the second of which has a silent subscript, are pronounced with the short inherent vowel /.../ or /.../, rather than the usual /a/, /.../ or /.../ (see Chapter IX, A 3 b).

* ... /sɑp/ every (cf. ... /sap/ sound)
* ... /.../ motor (cf. ... /.../ demon)

## 3. Exceptions to the Governance Rule

As a rule, the pronunciation of a vowel symbol is determined by the series of a preceding dominant consonant symbol (see Chapter VI, B). In some disyllabic and polysyllabic words, however, a passive 2nd series consonant symbol does not yield to a preceding dominant 1st series consonant symbol.

* អង្រឹង /.../ hammock (ct. ​អង្វរ /.../ to beg)
* ... /qaekkəriəc/ independence (cf. ... /saqkəraac/ era)

In some disyllables whose second syllable begins with the normally dominant 1st series ..., the ... is dominated by a preceding 2nd series consonant symbol.

* ទាហាន  /tiəhiən/ soldier (cf. ម្ហូប  /mhoup/ food)
* ... /wihiə/ temple (cf. រហូត /.../ until)

## 4. Silent Final Short Vowel Symbols

Some words are spelled with an unpronounced final short vowel symbol:

* ភូមិ /phuum/ village (cf. ... /lethig/ precept)
* ... /ciət/ life (cf. ... /matteq/ decision)
* ញាតិ /ñiət/ relative
* ... /kot/ monk’s quarters
* ប្រវត្តិ /.../ history
* ហេតុ /haet/ reason (cf. ... /.../ artifact)
* ... /thiət/ cremated remains

## 5. /ae/ɛɛ/ instead of /ei/ee/

In some words, the vowel symbol ... is pronounced as if it were ...; i.e. /ae/ in 1st series and /.../ in the 2nd. Below are some of the most common of these words:

* ខេត្ត /khaet/ province
* ... /pɛɛt/ doctor
* ចេតិយ /caetdəy/ stupa
* ... /patdesaet/ to cancel, destroy
* ...  /caəttənaa/ to like (cf. វេទនា /weetəniə/ miserable)
* ... /haet/ reason

## 6. /əy/ instead of /e/

The vowel symbol ... in some words is pronounced as if it were written ... when it occurs in a non-final syllable.

* ... /bəydaa/ father
* ... /səylaa/ (~ /seqlaa/) stone
* ... /bəysaac/ ghost

## 7. /a/ instead of /../

In a few words the constellation ... with a 1st series consonant symbol is pronounced /-ac/ rather than the regular /.../:

* ... /srac/ completely (cf. ... /məc/ why)
* ... /sɑmrac/ to finish
* ស្តេច /sdac/ King
* ... /sɑmdac/ royal title
