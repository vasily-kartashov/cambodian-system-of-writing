# Numerals and Abbreviation

## A. Numerals

Cambodian numeral symbols were borrowed from the same Indic source as the alphabet. Although Arabic numerals are well known, especially in urban areas, as a result of French influence, the Indic symbols (identical with those used in Thai) are used almost exclusively in Cambodian publications.

Aithough the symbols themselves are based on the decimal system, the names underlying them reveal an older system based on five, as can be seen in the names of the numerals 6-9, which are 5+1, 5+2, 5+3, and 5+4 respectively. The names of the numerals 1-9 and zero are as follows:

## C. Abbreviations

The use of abbreviations is not as common in Cambodian as in western languages; e.g., there are no established abbreviations for the names of months. Dictionaries and other technical works tend to coin abbreviations as needed; the official Cambodian Dictionary contains a long list of abbreviations for use in giving information about lexical entries, many of which are found in other dictionaries, and many of which were invented ad hoc. In addition, the following abbreviations are relatively standardized.

### 1. Dates

In Cambodian dates the Christian era is generally used for most publications. However, the traditional Buddhist era is used in older publications and in religious texts, and in many publications both are used concurrently. The Buddhist era is reckoned from the year of the death of the Buddha, usually considered to be the year 543 B.C, Thus, when confronted with a Buddhist era date, subtract 543 years to obtain the Christian era equivalent, e.g., B.E. 2510-543 = A.D, 1967. The two eras are abbreviated as follows:

When a date is written in its full form, the day of the week precedes, followed by the day of the month, the month, and the year, as in the following example:
