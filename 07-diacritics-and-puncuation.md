# Diacritics and Punctuation

## A. Diacritics

The following special symbols, with the exception of the /sraq qam/ (...) and the /.../ (...), are usually treated as diacritics (... /.../) in Cambodian textbooks. The /sraq qam/ and /réshmuk/ are listed as vowel symbols in Cambodian dictionaries (see Chapter IV, A), although in fact they represent combinations of vowel + consonant. These diacritics typically have several designations depending on the level of speech employed. There is furthermore a certain amount of confusion between them among literate Cambodians. Each symbol is listed here by its common pedagogical name, followed by alternative designations. Some of the following have already been encountered, but are included here for completeness.

## B. Punctuation

Although the common western punctuation marks, such as . , ; : ! ? ..., etc. are being used in Cambodian writing with increased frequency, as a result of French influence, there are a number of punctuation signs which are characteristically Cambodian,

### 1. ... /kliə/ space

Cambodian words are not normally separated by spaces in closely knit syntactic phrases or single-clause sentences. The /.../ ‘space’ is used in a way roughly analogous to the use of the comma in English, but is more comprehensive. There are stylistic differences from one text to another, but space typically occurs in the following situations:

a) between clauses within a sentence
b) between sentences in a cohesive group of sentences
c) after preposed adverbial words or phrases, such as “usually,” “today,” “in that town,” etc.
d) before and after proper names
e) before and after numbers
f) before and after the symbols ..., ..., ..., and ... (explained below)
g) between coordinate words in lists

Se of the uses of the /.../ are illustrated in the following sentence:

> ...
>
> /.../
>
> Today( )I’m going to the market( )to buy oranges( )rice( )and various things.



### 2. ខណ្ឌ /khan/ (។)

The /khan/, or ... /lbah/, is the Cambodian full stop. It occurs less frequently than the full stop in English (see 1 above). Although usage varies, the /khan/ normally occurs only at the end of a paragraph, i.e. a single sentence or several sentences dealing with a single theme or topic. Thus its occurrence usually signals the start of a new theme or topic in the text that follows.

### 3. បរិយោសាន /baariyaosaan/ or ... /lbah/ (៕)

The symbol ... is a full stop that implies more finality than the /khan/ above. It marks the end of a chapter or an entire text.

### 4. ... /koo-mout/ ‘cow's urine’ (៚)

The /koo-mout/ is a full stop symbol that, like the /baariyaosaan/ above, marks the absolute end of a text. It is usually reserved for poetic or religious texts. It sometimes occurs as the second part of the compound symbol ..., which is also called /baariyaosaan/.

### 5. ... /pnɛɛk moə̆n/ ‘cock's eye’ (... or ៙)

...

### 6. ចំណុចពីរគូស /camnoc pii kuuh/ ‘two dots and a slash’ (៖)

...

### 7. លេខទោ /leik too/ ‘the figure 2’ (ៗ)

...

### 8. ៘ /laq/ or ... /peiyaal/

...

### 9. សហសញ្ញា /sahaq-saññaa/ hyphen (-)

...

### 10.

The following punctuation marks are used much as in English, and may occur in Cambodian publications interspersed with the more traditional symbols discussed above. Their common Cambodian names are given below.
