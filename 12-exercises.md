# Programmed Reading Exercises

## Introduction

Part One of this book presents a formal analysis of the relationship between sound and symbol in modern Cambodian. The purpose of this section is to provide the student with a step-by-step introduction to reading and writing Cambodian words. Each exercise introduces a small amount of new material. The exercises are cumulative, building on and reinforcing points that have already been introduced. Periodic review exercises provide a test of the student’s progress, and refer by number to the exercise in which each point was first introduced. The student should go back and review the exercise dealing with any point in the review exercise with which he has difficulty.

Since the primary aim of this section, and indeed, of the entire book, is to develop facility in reading, the great majority of the exercises involve a symbol-to-sound operation. However, some of the exercises involve a sound-to-symbol operation (much less predictable in Cambodian), since it is felt that the most effective way to help the student recognize the sometimes minute differences between symbols is to have him draw them himself.

As in Part One, it is assumed that the student is familiar with the transcription system used in the author’s Spoken Cambodian, of which a summary is presented for convenience below.

However, if the student is unfamiliar with the sound system of spoken Cambodian, or if he intends to use this section without the aid of a native speaker, he should read carefully the chapter on Phonology in Part One. To use this section effectively, the student should follow these directions:

1. Cover the answer to each exercise (marked A.) with a blank sheet of paper.
1. Write the answer called for on the paper, and pronounce it aloud.
1. Check your answer against the correct answer which follows each exercise.
1. If you have made a mistake, practice the exercise until you can do it correctly from memory.
