# Introduction

## The Language

Cambodian, also known as Khmer, is the official language of the Kingdom of Cambodia. It is spoken by some 5,000,000 people in Cambodia, and mutually intelligible dialects are spoken by approximately 400,000 inhabitants of the provinces of Buriram, Surin, and Srisaket in northeastern Thailand, and by approximately 450,000 people in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam.

Cambodian is the major modern representative of the Mon-Khmer language family, which includes, besides Mon in Lower Burma, also hundreds of related dialects scattered over most of mainland Southeast Asia, such as the Palaung, Wa, and Riang in Burma; the Khmu, Lamet, and So in Laos; the Kuy, Chong, and Lawa in Thailand; the Stieng, Biet, and Samre in Cambodia; the Bahnar, Halang, and Sre in Vietnam; and possibly the Semang and Sakai in Malaya. No wider affiliation for the Mon-Khmer family has been conclusively demonstrated, although most linguists now think that Vietnamese is related to Mon-Khmer. Pater Wilhelm Schmidt’s hypothesis of an Austroasiatic language family on the Southeast Asian mainland, including, besides Mon-Khmer, also the Munda languages of northeastern India, Khasi in Assam, the Cham group in South Vietnam and Cambodia, Nicobarese, and Semang and Sakai in the Malay peninsula, is unwarranted by present evidence, and his further grouping of Austroasiatic with the Austronesian languages of island Southeast Asia to form an Austric superstock is even more speculative, although many of Schmidt’s assumptions have been proven correct by later research.

As for foreign influences on the language, the Cambodians have borrowed much of their administrative, military, and literary vocabulary from Sanskrit. With the advent of Theravada Buddhism at the beginning of the fifteenth century, Cambodian began to borrow Pali words, and continues to use Pali as a major source of neologisms today. Although Cambodian and Thai are not, so far as we know, genetically related, a high percentage of their vocabulary stems from a common source, as the result both of mutual borrowing over a long period of historical contact, and of common borrowing of learned terminology from Pali and Sanskrit. During the period of French domination, many French words were borrowed into the language and have become a part of the colloquial language, especially in urban areas. There is also a smattering of Chinese and Vietnamese loanwords in colloquial speech.

Unlike its neighbors Thai and Vietnamese, which are tonal and essentially monosyllabic, Cambodian is non-tonal and has a high percentage of disyllabic words. Like the Malayo-Polynesian languages, it has a relatively complex morphology, forming disyllabic derivatives from monosyllabic bases by prefixation and infixation, although these processes are rarely productive in the language.

The typical stress pattern in such disyllables is an unstressed presyllable followed by a stressed main syllable. Even polysyllabic loanwords from Pali and Sanskrit tend to be assimilated to this pattern of alternation between an unstressed and a stressed syllable.

## The System of Writing

The Cambodian script (called /qaqsaa kmae/‘Khmer letters’), as well as the Thai, Lao, Burmese, Old Mon, Old Cham, and Old Javanese scripts, are all derived from some form (or perhaps from various forms) of the ancient Brahmi script of South India. The earliest form of this script so far discovered in Southeast Asia is that of the Vo-canh Sanskrit inscription of the second or third century A.D., in the area of the old kingdom of Funan. The exact geographical source in India of these scripts has not been determined, but epigraphers find great similarity between the earliest inscriptions in Southeast Asia and those of the early Pallawa kingdom of Kanchi on the Coromandel coast of India. The earliest inscription in the Cambodian language is that found at Angkor Borei in Takéo Province of southern Cambodia, and is dated 611 A.D.5 Since this inscription was found in what would have been the area of Funan, the first known Indianized kingdom in Southeast Asia (first century A.D. to c. 550 A.D.), and since no vernacular inscriptions dating from the time of Funan have been discovered in the area, Cambodian may have been the language of Funan. At any rate, the fact that Cambodian was the language of Chen-La (550-802 A.D.), Funan’s successor in the Mekong Valley, and of the great kingdom of Angkor (802~1431 A.D.), whose suzerainty at its height extended eastward to the sea, northward to Tongking and northern Laos, westward to Burma, and southward to Malaya, is attested by an abundance of stone inscriptions covering the period from the seventh to the eighteenth centuries.Furthermore, the fact that pockets of speakers of Mon-Khmer-related dialects are found all over mainland Southeast Asia seems to indicate that Mon-Khmer in fact represents a much older linguistic substratum which was later engulfed, partially assimilated, and pushed into the hills by succeeding migrations of Vietnamese, Tai, and Burmese.

Part One of this book is a description of the relationship, or the “fit,” between the sounds (i.e. the phonological structure) of modern Cambodian and the symbols (i.e, the written system) that are used to represent them. Writing systems differ widely in terms of the closeness of the fit between sound and symbol; i.e. in the regularity with which a given symbol represents a given sound. By this yardstick the Cambodian writing system is a much better writing system than, for example, that used to represent English. A description of the English writing system would consist, after a nucleus of “regular” spellings, of an almost endless list of exceptions. An example of this confusing irregularity is the variety of sounds represented by the symbols _-ough_ in the words _rough_, _cough_, _bough_, _slough_, and _hiccough_. The Cambodian writing system, on the other hand, represents the sounds of Cambodian with remarkably little ambiguity, especially at the level of common vocabulary. There are exceptions, of course, especially at the level of learned vocabulary borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali sources. These exceptions will be dealt with as exhaustively as possible, but it would be impossible, even for as regular a writing system as Cambodian, to list them all.

Although Cambodian spelling has historically been plagued by a lack of standardization, much progress has been made toward standardization in recent years, largely through the efforts of the scholars of the Buddhist Institute, whose excellent two-volume official dictionary -- /waccenaanukram kmae/ ‘Cambodian Dictionary’ (Item 4 in the Bibliography) -- has been used as the authority for the spellings in this book. Common alternative spellings are given for some words.
